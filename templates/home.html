          <h2>How Netflix uses Python | Netflix and Python | Python Applications </h2>
            <p style="color:black">

                Before we begin justmake sure you subscribe to our Channel and hitthe Bell icon to stay updated with all
                the latestEdureka videos. Coming back towards the session, Let's first beginwith a small introduction to
                Netflix and then weshall move on to see how Netflix uses python in various sectorssuch as for its CDN,
                which is open connect Fordham and engineering and machinelearning big data analytics and scientific
                experimentationsvideo encoding animations security and finally formonitoring and auto remediation. So
                without any further delays, let's get Did Netflix as we all know isan American company which renders
                videoon demand Services.
                And the number however keepsgrowing each day in a period of approximately two decadesNetflix has
                emerged as the king of its clanfor the biggest TV series and movies throughout
                It's enough for itto be an eye-catcher. Thereby interesting allinto its technical spheres. Let's move on
                to see how Netflix uses pythonin its various domains.video248 million subscribers. Now that we've taken
                the nameof Syrian over here. Let's move onto see what this is and how it makes useof python the CDN or
                content delivery Network that Netflix makes useof is open connect. This basicallycomes into picture when
                you hit the play button allthe content delivered to the end user is looked after by this CDNopen connect
                basically requires various other software'sto design built and operated which are in turnwritten in
                Python. Not just this the network devices underlying this CDNour python applications since python is
                prominentin solving network issues. Now that we are aware of thefirst component open connect. Let's move
                on to see how Netflix usespython for its demand engineering the design.The library is used bythis team
                are the numpy and the Sci-Fi Library, which is used for performingnumerical analysis both 03, which is
                the softwaredevelopment kit of the Amazon web services for python. This helps python developersintegrate
                python into AWS. Thereby allowing developmentin the infrastructure radius, Q or r q, which is a python
                Library which helps to keeptrack of the tasks that are present in the queueand allows their
                execution.Now, let's move on to see how python is used for machinelearning machine learning ranges from
                creatingpersonalization algorithms to figuring outthe use cases personalization algorithms help to
                trainthe machine learning models as per the Netflix standard.The library is required to learndeep neural
                networks are tensorflow Kara'sand Pie thought whereas XG boost and light GBM for gradientboosted
                decision trees. Netflix has also developed quitea few higher level libraries that help in combiningwith
                the work area such as fact logging featureextraction publishing Etc.A major part of this orchestrationis
                written in Python. This team uses a schedulerwhich runs on jupyter notebooks with paper mills to
                producejob types with templates. For example, spark Presto Etc.They've created a numberof events and
                combined it into a single one allowingNetflix to filter react and Route events. Okay. So now let's move
                on to see how python is usedfor scientific experimentations. This platform is basicallycreated for
                experimentations and to allow A/B Testing guys a be testing is alsocalled a split testing and it deals
                with comparing two versions and figuringout the better performing.he python framework that has
                implementedhere is metrics report which is based on Pi Pika and allows writing ofreusable parameterised
                queries for the statistics sector by arrow and rpy to are usedto calculate the statistics in either
                python or are plotly helpsin visualizations video encoding or media Cloud engineering thisteam is
                responsible for encoding and re-encoding tasks for the Netflix catalog. Python is used approximately450
                projects such as the V math which is videomulti-method assessment fusion and mezzanine file
                systemcomputer vision solution, which deals with imageryusing Archer Etc. Netflix animation and N
                VFXpython forms the basis for all animations and visual effectsat Netflix Maya and nuke which are 3D and
                2Dcomputer Graphics applications are united using python. Now, let's move on to see how Netflix uses
                pythonfor its information security Netflix uses pythonpod information systems for auto
                remediationsecurity automation risk classifications Etc. The most activeopen source project of this team

          <h2>Installing Python 3 and PyCharm in Win 10</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                let's start, I'm in windows 10 right here and I've already gone to python.org
                this is where you get python and you can get documentation information about Python go ahead and click,
                hover over downloads and you should see, there it is, a couple buttons come up and you want to click on
                python 3.6 and this will start your download for whatever operating system you're in we're going through
                the windows 10 but the steps are going to be the same in whatever you're in, go ahead and hit save will
                start the download go ahead and hit run, its going to start running, this is where it's going to install
                it right here. It's in the users directory under your account name and it's in usually hidden folder
                from the finder but that's where it's going to install. it also includes program called IDLE which we're
                going to show you i like to add it to the path so if i use PowerShell or the command prompt i can type
                Python directly from there so go ahead and click this and go ahead and hit install now, i'll give it
                permission to do that too from windows. don't worry because it says 32 bit and you might have a 64-bit
                operating system. Both 32-bit and 64-bit python is available but there's no real reason to use a 64-bit
                operating system if you're just a beginner in Python. The 64-bit version of Python does allow you to use
                an incredible lot more memory but you probably don't have that much memory installed as a student. OK,
                it's all done, this says it was successful so we're just going to close this and I'm going to show you
                how to test that it was installed correctly, so we're going to go to your Start menu and you'll see IDLE
                -- I.D.L.E. if you don't see this listed you can just type I D L E and Windows 10 or windows 8 will find
                it and we're going to open it up and once it's open this basically verifies that python is working at
                this open so it says python 3.60 it's open up python we can just type in a number like 5 and it just
                echos out five and that basically shows us it's running Python so it we gave it a literal number five
                and programming language and it just gave us back what we typed in, so I'm going to go ahead and close
                this and we're going to go on to installing pycharm now, pycharm is by out a company called jetbrains
                it's a complete IDE like visual studio, I'm just going to search for it... Pycharm you see here's the
                official site go there and we're going to hit download now now there are two versions this is a free
                version it's called the community of version or CE version and there's a professional version which you
                can apply for a student if you have an email from a college to download, I found there's nothing I need
                in the professional version even for most python i do so and for class words we all we need is community
                edition for a beginner. so we're going to go ahead and download this, it's going to take longer to
                download then Python did. so let's go ahead and run and give it permission to install here and we're
                going to hit next and next, now here you can create a shortcut on your desktop and but one thing you
                might want to do is make this file association all python files where you actually type a program in .py
                just like java files in .java and C++ files end in, and I think it's .cpp, so go ahead and click this
                and hit next and then install. and go ahead and hit finish or if you want to run it right way you can
                click this normally we would run it from the start menu and here it is this is the recently added list
                so if it doesn't show up here again you might have to search for pycharm so we're going to go ahead and
                start it here first time it starts at ask if you want to import from a previous version which we aren't
                going to we don't have a previous versions we can't just say okay ok and we're going to just accept this
                dialogue here say okay, now there's some setup we're going to do before we start, whenever you first
                part startup pycharm if you haven't been working with a project or you have no project open you get this
                welcome screen and the welcome screen allows you to create a new project which is a folder it's going to
                contain some program you're working on which may be multiple files or you can open an existing project
                and we're going to go to configure and go to settings and there's one important setting that you have to
                tell pycharm so it applies to all projects you do it at this phase you go to where it says project
                interpreter this is what version of python we want to use now we've only installed one version but
                pycharm doesn't know that. for technical reasons you may have multiple versions on your computer so
                we're going to just pull this down and c

            <p style="color:black">
                >> Ever wondered how devices like this small little RaspberryPi get attacked by hackers? Ofir, from the
                AzureSecurity Center team will show us a demo of what happen when someone tries to breach your device
                andhow we're protecting that. [MUSIC] >> Hi everyone. this is often the IoT Show. We are on the road at
                Ignite 2019, and i am here with Ofir from theAzure Security Center team, and we'll talk security with
                IoT. Ofir, thanks for joiningthe IoT Show today. >> Sure. Sure. I'mreally happy to be here. >> So Ofir,
                tell us about yourself and what your team isdoing at Microsoft. >> Okay. So I'm Ofir. I'm leading the
                Detectionteam in Azure IoT security. So actually we'refocused on IP security. >> Okay. >>I have a
                talented team of securityresearchers and developers, and we're building the securityaround the IoT of
                Azure. >> Okay. So we discussed that with a number of yourcolleagues already, what the overview on IoT
                in AzureSecurity Center feels like. Let's dive into a number of these demos because we talkedabout the
                principles of it, but let's have a look at it in action. >> Okay. Sure. Sure. I'llbe happy to try and do
                that. >> Tell me then. >> So what you seehere, you'll be able to hold it. >> Let me hold it. >> it is a
                Raspberry Pi. >> Yeah. >> Actually you'll be able to see it here. That's a Raspberry Pi. >> Yeah. >>
                it's connected toa touchscreen which is running Ubuntu Linux wireless. It's connected to a network. this
                is often only the electricity. >> Got it. >> Actually, it's live.You can see here. >> Yeah. >> It's
                running. We're going toshow you a extremely cool demo. >> Okay. >> I'm visiting attack that device. >>
                you are going to attack the device. >> Yes, so hold it tight. So confirm you retain it safe. >> it isn't
                visiting burnor something, right? >> i do not promise, then now, we're visiting see how it works. >>
                Okay. So is that one connectedright now to Azure IoT Hub? >> Exactly. >> Okay. >> in order that device
                isconnected to Azure IoT Hub. >> Okay. >> The hub that youcan see up here. >> Okay. Got it. >> i've got
                several devices connected, and one in all them isthat specific device. >> Okay. >> this can be a daily
                IoT Hub. Most devices, if they'reworking with the Azure, they're connected to Azure IoT hub. >> Yeah. >>
                On Azure IoT Hub, in Azure portal, you'll just click on the "Security", "Enable the Security"and then
                you have got it protected by the AzureSecurity Center for IoT. >> Okay. There's anagent running in
                there, and you guys provide as an open source projectthat people integrate into the code together with
                the IoT Hub SDK to integrate intothat infrastructure. >> Exactly. So agent is anopen source as you're
                saying. It supports plenty of flavors, and it actually monitors everythingthat goes on, on it device. So
                every connection,every executable, if an administrator isadded to the system, in order that way we are
                able to keep track of everything that isgoing thereon device. >> Okay. >> therefore the device is
                connected. Actually, we're visiting look inthe security alerts and verify, but currently we don't have
                anyalerts before we start the demo, so our page here isclear of alerts, empty. >> No data to display. >>
                There are some recommendations. >> Okay. >> this is often something we're visiting discuss at the top of
                the demo. >> Okay. >> Recommendation are the simplest way to inform you ways to enhance the safety. >>
                Okay. >> But we are going to retreat to to it. So actually what I'll do now's I'm running a Linuxmachine
                on my computer, and i am visiting try to connect from my computer to the IoTthat you're now holding. >>
                Okay. >> I'm doing that right here. >> Okay. >> Actually, I'm startingwith the straightforward way of
                trying to work out what isthe password of that device. >> employing a brute forceattack on it device. >>
                Exactly. >> Okay. >> this can be what we calla brute force attack. >> Yeah. >> For password. Usually,
                whatattackers do is they're employing a dictionary ofdefault credentials. >> Okay. >> Those are
                literally thecredentials that lots of devices set out of the factory with. >> Root password andthis
                reasonably things. >> Exactly. So for instance, Mirai was the famous IoT attack that few years ago
                causeda massive DDoS attack, and Mirai used onlyabout 60 passwords, only 60 difficultcredentials and
                therewith managed to infectthousands of devices out there. So I'm keep trying.

          <h2>What makes IoT Security different? | Azure IoT</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                IoT security is different, and I would say a very important. Because it now goes allthe way to your
                devices. It cannot just stayonly in the Cloud or in your applications which are runningin the Cloud or
                even On-prem, nor your connecting deviceswhich might be out there. These devices are heterogeneous, so
                they could be big, small, many operating systems,many different operating systems, they could actually
                haveno operating system on them as well, but they are all connected, and they're all doingsomething
                important. Either they're pulling out data from that environment and sending itto that application in
                the Cloud, or they're actuating something, they are controlling something. Hence, making sure that
                yourend-to-end IoT security is good, is extremely important and it goes beyond what we're used todoing
                with IoT security. >> Okay. So there's a lot ofthings that you highlighted there from the devices
                themselves, and then sometimes the devicesthey define themselves and interestingenvironments as well
                where you can't trust the environment. What should people thinkabout when they're thinking about
                potentially hostilenetworks or environments? >> Yeah. So one of course is because of the heterogeneityof
                all these devices. Also, the heterogeneityin the sense that there are some new devicesand some older
                devices, and so the devices may not be designed to be secure ifthey're very old ones. So, we need to
                think aboutall of these together. We need to think about how dowe bring in these devices and what are
                the security propertiesof each of these devices? How do these security propertieswork with the
                application? Then of course there aremany things that we can provide. We have features in the Cloud
                which allow youto control your devices, we also have things like SDKs, we have a product calledLayer
                Sphere, and so on. So we have a lot ofthese things that we have built in and we have talked about, which
                give you security,end-to-end security. >> Yeah. That makes sense. One of the things thatI actually
                really enjoy about Microsoft IoTis that there are a lot of patterns and abstractionsthat we provide
                because there's a lot of complication going on with all these different thingsthat you've mentioned, so
                it's hard for you totake in all at once. But if they can rely on patterns, that makes it a little bit
                easier. So, can you talk through whatsome of the core patterns or abstractions are that we provide that
                peoplecan take advantage of? >> Yeah. So of coursewe have the Cloud, which allows you to secure whatever
                you are lendingthem inherently. So we provide all theinfrastructure which is secure. You can run an
                applicationthere and it will give you a secure infrastructure to runthat application in the Cloud. So
                that's one pattern,the Cloud pattern, then we have patterns on the devices. On the device side we have
                the SDKs, the Azure IoT device SDKs whichare open sourced on GitHub, you include those in your devices
                when you are putting those together. These devices and the SDKon top of it provides you with an
                abstraction on topof your device itself. It could also be the securityproperties of the device. For
                example, do you havethe hardware-based Root of Trust? The SDK provides you withan abstraction on the
                device. The other one is the IoT Edge, Azure IoT Edge whichis another product that we have from
                Microsoft, which allows you to dothese abstractions together. So it can allow you to bringCloud services
                to Edge devices, as well as to have the local abstractions whichare because of the SDKs. So, all of
                these differentabstractions from the SDK, to IoT Edge, to the Cloud services, get together and
                provideyou with a way to think about securityat a higher level, and not have to worryabout the down
                below, how do I actually go andaccess hardware and so on. That's all covered inthese abstractions. >>
                Yeah. That's great. As we getdown below those abstractions, start thinking aboutthe details of IoT
                security. IoT devices always come up. That's what people thinkof when they think of IoT. So, what do you
                need to createor to have a secure IoT device? >> Yeah. So of course that'sa challenge as we just
                described, heterogeneity, so manydifferent devices. So a few years back, coupleof years back we all
                stepped back at Microsoft andwe started thinking about, what are the properties thatoffer highly secure
                device? We came up with a set ofprinciples and properties, we call them The Seven Properties ofHighly
                Secure Devices. Now, these propertieshave been known to the security communityfor a long time. But what
                we did there was, we put them together inthe world of IoT device. Some of them for example, a device
                needs to havea hardware based Root of Trust, in which you aresecuring your secrets, and your keys, and
                your certificates. So that's one property. Another property is, thedevice should be updatable.

          <h2>DIY Smart Mirror - Complete Guide (2020)</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                I'm visiting take you throughmy top pro-level tips that are visiting saveyou a lot of
                time on your next smartmirror project. I'm visiting outline exactlywhat glass type you wish, a way to
                frame it, and the way toadd touch to your smart mirror. Hi, I'm Krista, gadgetgeek for
                twowaymirrors.com. OK, let's start. a wise mirror works by placinga semi-transparent mirror ahead of a
                display. it is important touse the most effective mirror type ahead of your displayfor the utmost
                clarity through the mirror. So you'll be wanting to use amirror specifically designed for smart mirror
                projects. you'll be able to use TVs, monitors,tablets, any display that you simply want. Here's how
                you'll quicklyframe your smart mirror. Use a shadow box frame likethis one, check it out. OK, now I'm
                visiting showyou how it all fits together. First, you've got your frame. The frame is what holdsthe
                glass and also the touch screen in situ. The shadow box is deep. So after you layer the mirror,the IR
                touch, and therefore the display, it'll be completelyhidden from the side. If you're lookingto avoid
                wasting time, you'll be able to purchase theframe directly from us. to urge the proper size, you'llwant
                to live your display. i like to recommend going with theoverall size of the display, or if you're adding
                touch,measure the outer dimensions of your IR touch frame. which will be your mirror size. That way
                everythingfits nice and neat. OK, let's dig deeper into this. People question me all thetime, does the
                mirror need to be the samesize because the display? you'll definitely go largerwith your smart mirror
                where the display only takes asmall portion of that screen. Just remember, pro tip rightnow, if you are
                doing go larger, you wish to form sure that youpaint the rear of that mirror black everywhere exceptfor
                where the screen is. this can ensure you get anice mirror finish everywhere on your mirror. Next pro tip
                i've got for youis choosing the correct mirror for the project. you cannot use justany old two-way
                mirror for this project. to realize the bestdisplay quality coming through that mirror, you'llwant
                either the smart mirror or the dielectric mirror. The smart mirror comesin glass and acrylic. Both offer
                great reflectionand transparencies. In large sizes, suchas 40 inches and up, i like to recommend going
                withthe glass to confirm you've got a pleasant flat reflection. this can be what the glasssmart mirror
                sounds like. The reflection looks justlike a customary mirror, and therefore the text showsthrough nice
                and clear. If you intend to be displayingvideo or graphics, the dielectric mirror isa more transparent
                option. i like to recommend thedielectric mirror for flawless picture clarity. this can be an exampleof
                a two-way mirror. The glass two-way mirror is70% reflective and only 11% transparent. in order that
                display quality justgoes right down the roof. you'll barely see thetext through the mirror. By the way,
                I'veheard a large amount of individuals messing up their projectsusing the two-way mirror film. Yeah,
                this one right here. The two-way mirror filmis only 5% transparent, so it's blocking almost allthe light
                through the mirror, a.k.a., your white textwith that black background goes to disappear. and that is
                right, you'lljust get a mirror, not a wise mirror. Avoid the two-waymirror film the least bit costs if
                you'll because it's blurryand it bubbles over time. Final step, now youjust plug a computer in. you wish
                a computer so you canput that text on the display. the foremost popular optionis a Raspberry Pi B+. I'm
                totally geekingout thereon right away, especially if you go tomagicmirror.builders. they are doing have
                a oneline of code option where you'll just putthat one line of code in, and suddenly you havethe five
                basic widgets to display the time, theweather, inspirational quotes, securities market. But anyway,
                onmagicmirror.builders, you'll see all of thethird party modules. So people are contributingto this all
                the time, so it's constantlygetting updated, and you'll be able to add so muchfunctionality to that. But
                you'll be able to also use anAndroid, or a Windows, Intel Compute Stick,it's really up to you. i do
                know-- I know there's a hugegeek factor with the Raspberry Pis. Geek on my friends. If you have got any
                questions, leaveme a comment below immediately. Until next time, I'm Kristawith twowaymirrors.com. and i
                am outie 5000.

          <h2>Raspberry Pi Project: Touch Weather Station using a DHT22 and a Raspberry Pi 3 with TKInter GUI.</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                Dear friends welcome back! The summer is over and that i am back with a newproject. Today we are
                visiting test the new RaspberryPi 3 board, by building a straightforward but useful project. We are
                visiting build slightly Screen WeatherStation. Let’s start. some months back, the Raspberry Pi 3
                boardwas released. it's a good new board because it now offersWiFi and Bluetooth connectivity out of the
                box! It uses a quad core processor which operatesat 1.2Ghz and it's 1GB of RAM available. From the
                benchmarks i've got seen, this boardis a minimum of 3 times faster than the initial Raspberry Pi. It can
                run Linux and offers 40 GPIO pins forour projects. The impressive thing is its price. It costs around
                40$ and Gearbest.com was kindenough to send me a sample unit so as to check it and build projects with
                it. you'll find a link for it within the descriptionof the video. so as to check it, I built this
                WeatherStation with it. As you'll be able to see, i've got connected a 5’ inchtouch display and a DHT22
                sensor and within the screen we are able to see live update of the temperatureand humidity. The
                temperature and therefore the humidity values areupdated every two seconds. If I click anywhere on the
                screen, the applicationsquits so we will use the Raspberry Pi for other purposes. This project could be
                a nice first project to buildwith a Raspberry Pi, because you'll find out how write and run code
                thereon, and you willlearn a way to use the GPIO pins of it. But let’s now see the way to build this
                project. The parts needed so as to create this projectare these: • A Raspberry Pi 3 or the other
                RaspberryPi board • A DHT22 Temperature and humidity sensor• A 5” Touch Display • Some wiresYou can find
                link for all the parts within the description of the video. Now, let’s connect all the parts together.
                First we've to attach the DHT22 sensor. We connect the pin with + symbol to GPIO pin40 of the Raspberry
                Pi. Although Pin 40 isn't connected to three.3V wewill configure it to be HIGH within the code later. We
                connect the bottom pin of the sensor toGPIO pin 39. Lastly we connect the output pin of the sensorto
                digital pin 38. the subsequent step is to connect the display. it's very easy. you'll also watch a close
                tutorial I haveprepared about this display by clicking on the cardboard here. That’s it, now we are able
                to power up the RaspberryPi and cargo the code. Now that the Raspberry Pi is prepared to usedownload the
                code of the project from the link within the description of the video and placeit in a very folder named
                WeatherStation. together with the code you'll find a file namedbackground.gif which is that the
                background image for our project. Next we've to put in a pair of libraries. First of all we've got to
                download the DHT22sensor library from adafruit. Unzip the library on the desktop, open theConsole and
                sort the subsequent 2 commands.sudo python setup.py installThat’s it. The DHT library is prepared to
                use. the subsequent step is to put in an imaging library. Type the subsequent 2 commands and wait
                theinstallation procedure to complete. then we are able to use the code. Navigate to the project folder
                with the command:cd Desktop/WeatherStation Then just run the code with the command:sudo python
                WeatherStation.py The program will run and after some secondsthe temperature and also the humidity
                readings will appear. you'll exit the applying by clicking anywhereon the screen if you have got
                installed the drivers for the touch display. Let’s now take a fast take a look at the codeto see how it
                works. The code uses the TKinter Graphical User Interfacepackage. we've used it within the past further
                and Ihave prepared a video on it, you'll be able to check it out by clicking on the cardboard here.
                Watching that video will facilitate your better understandwhat’s occurring here. initially we declare
                all the libraries thatwe are visiting use. Next we define the GPIO pin 40 as an outputand we set it to
                HIGH so as to supply power to the DHT22 sensor.

          <h2>Which Motor Type is the Best Generator? || DC, BLDC or Stepper? (Experiment)</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                When it comes to the integration of motion in projects, then hobbyists usually have three big motor type
                options they can choose from There's the DC motor, the BLDC motor, and the stepper motor Their job is to
                convert electrical power into mechanical power by sometimes simply applying a DC voltage and Sometimes
                applying that voltage in a more complicated way If you want to learn more about the working behavior of
                such motors Then I would highly recommend you to watch my videos about the mentioned three motor types
                Anyway, what everyone probably tried out at some point was soldering an LED to the input terminals of a
                DC motor and spinning its shaft, which miraculously illuminated the LED The reason is that we reversed
                the energy flow meaning we now create electrical energy from mechanical energy and thus, use the motor
                as a generator and This brings me to the subject of this video which is about conducting a couple of
                experiments in order to find out which one of those three classical hobbyist motors is best suited as a
                generator Let's get started... [music plays] This video is sponsored by JLCPCB, which is ideal for cheap
                and fast PCB turnarounds From prototypes to high-volume productions they can do a delivery on time in
                99% of the cases So upload your Gerber files to order high quality PCBs First off why would you want to
                use a generator? Well coming from the industrial side of view, most electrical energy that we consume is
                Generated like the name implies by a generator whose shaft is spun by turbine fueled by for example gas
                or coals But coming from a hobbyist side, a generator can be useful for windmill experiments which you
                know is always fun. So, Let's imagine. We got a steady breeze and thus a constant torque on the
                generator shafts to simulate the situation, I will be using an ODrive BLDC motor With a 3d printed motor
                mount and an attached encoder to the motor shafts In combination with the fitting o drive control
                boards, this motor becomes powerful and quite versatile. Since it can be rotated very slowly, Almost
                completely silent and best of all, it can go to a position and stay there with a holding torque- Due to
                the utilization of the encoder So, all in all, the ODrive is pretty awesome But, since a more appealing
                graphical interface would be more suitable for this experiment. I would rather switch to the VESC About
                which I also talked in a previous video Now after calibrating the ODrive motor with the VESC tool I will
                be using the duty cycle control for this experiment That means that is a duty cycle and thus average
                voltage will be applied to the motor phases which, on the other hand, means that as soon as a bigger
                load gets attached to the motor the rotation speed would decrease Which would be just like attaching a
                bigger load to a constant wind force During the experiment, I will be recording the input power of the
                motor and and the output power of the generator and thus at the end calculate the efficiency of the
                whole system As a load for the three generators, I will be using 50 Ohm power resistors which are added
                to about any other components to the DC motor since it only produces a DC voltage The stepper motor, on
                the other hand, with its four wires just delivered two beautiful sinusoidal voltages Which require two
                full bridge rectifiers and capacitors in order to turn them into a DC voltage as well Last but not
                least, we got the BLDC motor which is the most complicated Since it offers 3 phase shifted, not that
                beautiful looking sinusoidal voltages But luckily the motor is configured in a star build-up which means
                we can use a "sechspuls Brückenschaltung" [3 phase rectifier] Basically a full bridge rectifier with two
                more diodes and capacitors, in order to once again, get a DC voltage on the output and with the
                electronics being completed it was time for the final step: the mechanical connection between the motor
                and the generators Now for the DC motor and the stepper motor, it was simple since I had an 8 mm to 5 mm
                shaft coupler laying around But of course, that would not fit for the BLDC motor shaft so I downloaded
                another shaft coupler from thingiverse 3d printed it, enlarged its holes to 8 mm's and mounted it onto
                the BLDC motor and With that being done. It was time for the experiment. I utilized the duty cycles 0.1,
                0.15, 0.2 and 0.25 and like stated before, recorded the input power of the motor and the output voltage
                of the generator across the resistor Since we know the exact value of it, we can later easily calculate
                the output power But nevertheless, what stood out to me while recording the values was that the DC motor
                as a generator Was rather loud and vibrated a lot during operation The stepper motor on the other hand
                rotated the smoothest and the BLDC motor was a mix of both the previous generators and with the values
                being recorded it was time for the evaluation Now, the output power of the BLDC was the lowest While the
                DC and stepper motor were able to output about the same at four point something watts The average
                efficiency of the DC motor and the stepper motor was around 20-30% Which is acceptable if you consider
                that we included losses from the VESC, the motor, the mechanical connection, the generator, and the
                rectifier and also, we did not have a variable load on the outputs But what was definitely not
                acceptable was the efficiency of the BLDC motor which was at four percent at best Which brings us to the
                question: what is going on here?

                all of those components are pretty muchworthless if you do not have the right tools to work with them by
                for example solderingor securing them in place. That is why today I want to present you mychoice of the
                essential tools that you will need for creating electronics projects. And I know that I already did a
                video likethis but the video I am referring to is now almost 6 years old and a lot of things changedfor
                me since then. The way this video will play out is that Iwill be presenting you all of my tools from all
                my drawers, workbenches and shelves andwhile doing so I will focus on the ones that I am using the
                mostWith that being said let’s not waste any more time and let’s get started! This video is sponsored by
                JLCPCB, who producehigh quality PCBs for a very affordable price. I used their PCBs in dozens of
                projects sofar and never had any problems with them. So why not try out their service today byuploading
                your Gerber files and receiving your ordered PCBs sometimes even within aweek. Firstly let’s have a look
                at what toolsI have on my main workbench and what tools hang on the wall right in front of it. On the
                workbench I got a soldering station,a hot air reflow station, 2 oscilloscopes, 4 lab bench power
                supplies, one variable transformer,two function generators, one bench top multimeter, two microscopes
                and one SLA 3D printer. Out of those tools I think the lab bench powersupply is the most important one.
                I have so many of them because each one gota different voltage and current limit but I can advise that
                adjustable 30V with an adjustablecurrent limit of 3A will be enough for 95% of all DC projects. And you
                can get a decent lab bench power supplyfor pretty cheap nowadays. Next you need a decent soldering
                station,preferably one with a bunch of tips that you can change so that you are armed for everysoldering
                task, small or big. Now my station is not really the most budgetfriendly one but if you want a versatile
                soldering iron that I can recommend such a TS100 portableone which is quite a bit cheaper. You can power
                it with a mains power adapteror with a LiPo battery which I truly appreciate for outdoor projects and
                obviously it alsosolders well. Next you will need an oscilloscope for checkingdifferent waveforms and
                frequencies in your circuit but I would definitely not recommendthe oscilloscope I am always using
                because it is super expensive. Instead I would recommend such a 1000X seriesscope from Keysight because
                they cost a lot less and they also come with an integratedfunction generator which is the next tool that
                I constantly use. Even though I mostly create DC circuits itis kind of surprising how often you have to
                deal with different waveforms and that iswhy having a good function generator is crucial when it comes
                to creating or working withsuch circuits. Last but not least I think that a decent microscopeis super
                important when it comes to dealing with SMD circuits. Both of mine are from Andonstar and I canhighly
                recommend them. With that being said let’s move on to thewall where I got two handheld multimeters, a
                bunch of screw drivers, tweezers, two hammers,a digital caliper, a metal ruler and a try square.
                Probably the most important tool from thoseare my multimeters which you need for measuring voltage,
                current and other electrical values. Mine are from Gossen Metrawatt and way tooexpensive for a hobbyist
                maker. But there certainly exist lots of decent budgetfriendly options. Next I would say that having a
                bunch of differentscrew drivers lying around is super important when working with enclosure or something
                similar. But for the remaining tools I cannot reallydecide which one is more or less important to have
                around since they are all kind ofimportant. So to make your life easier you can find alist off all my
                recommended tools with attached picture gallery in the video description. With that being said let’s
                move on to myfirst tools cabinet and its first drawer which is simply labeled tools. After I removed it
                we can see its insideswhich mostly consist of cutters, pliers and wire strippers. Out of those I
                recommend owning a decent boxcutter, wire cutter, wire stripper and needle nose plier since they are
                essential toolswhen it comes to dealing with all kinds of wires and cables. Now the next drawer is
                labeled drill and likethe name implies we can find all kinds of tools associated with drilling inside
                it. Out of those I advise having such a smallelectric drill around since it is way faster to use than
                screwdrivers. Along with it you will need tons of bits whichI all got stored in custom 3D printed
                enclosures that you can find on thingiverse. Besides the small drill you will also needa bigger one like
                this for which I would recommend having wood drills bits, metal drill bitsand even a step drill bits in
                order to create all kinds of holes for projects. Moving on, the next drawer is called filecrimp in which
                we can, not surprisingly, find all kinds of rasps and crimp related toolsand materials. Now first off I
                am not that much into crimpconnectors so I would say that it is not that important. But what is
                important on the other hand ishaving such a small rasp set in combination with such a bigger rasp set
                since you willdefinitely need it for treating wood, metal and even 3D printed enclosures. Ok, the next
                drawer is labelled Saw LED Stripsand its content is once again not a surprise.

          <h2>Automating a Greenhouse with LoRa! (Part 1) || Sensors (Temperature, Humidity, Soil Moisture)</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                About 4 months ago I built this greenhousein my garden which as you can see now houses well growing
                plants. I got cucumbers, strawberries, sugar melon,watermelon, tomatoes and bell peppers of which
                surprisingly not one died yet. But that does not mean that everything goesperfectly which you can easily
                figure out if we look at certain leaves or this stem. The problem is a fungus which was caused byhigh
                humidity and could have been avoided if I opened the window more often. But on the positive side, this
                problem plantedthe idea of an automated greenhouse inside my head. This system should measure the
                temperature,humidity and soil moisture inside the greenhouse; send this data through a LoRa wireless
                connectionto a gateway in my apartment 300m away which then uploads it to the Internet of Thingswebsite
                where I can check on it everywhere in the world. And as a bonus the system should also be ableto use
                motors in order to not only open the window to control the temperature and humiditybut also to water the
                plants if the soil moisture is too low. And of course this automated greenhouse shouldget powered
                through the sun and thus also requires a solar power system. And in this first part of this two part
                videoseries I will show you how I built the green house, how I wired up the power and sensorsystem and
                what kind of programming is necessary in order to get all the required sensor datainto the internet.
                This video is sponsored by JLCPCB, where youcan now buy 5 pieces of 4 layer PCBs for a price of only 5$.
                So why not upload your Gerber files todayin order to experience their 24h fast production time, super
                quick delivery and excellent qualityPCBs. To start off this project I searched for abig yet affordable
                greenhouse on the internet and I found this one with measurements of190 by 380cm. As soon as I received
                it, I opened up thepackage which contained the metal foundation and laid it onto my lawn to determine a
                suitablespot. Then I cut the grass, marked the greenhousesquare with a spade and started breaking up the
                grass and afterwards removed most of it. While doing so I also had the unique experienceof removing a
                dead tree stump which I will hopefully never have to do again in my life. But anyway as soon as that was
                done I distributedthe soil in my square a bit more evenly and continued by screwing together the metal
                foundationwhich I then moved into position. After I was certain that the foundation waslevel by
                obviously utilizing a spirit level, I opened up the remaining packages which containedthe main parts for
                the greenhouse. And according to the given manual we thenconnected all aluminum beams with one another
                through the help of the included connectorpieces and screws. Now this part sounds like it was simple
                todo but in reality it took quite a while to find the correct aluminum parts and connectorssince the
                manual was not always that easy to follow. But nevertheless after a few hours we completedthe metal
                construction on the lawn before we moved it all over to the foundation towhich we then secured it with
                more connectors and screws. At this point all that was left to do wasto add the plastic windows which
                had to get secured in place with dozens of clips. And just like that the greenhouse itself
                wassuccessfully built. Now at this point I do not want to bore youwith plant growing tutorials, so let’s
                just say that suddenly lots of plants appearedin my greenhouse and let’s instead continue with the
                electronics. There we can distinguish between the powerelectronics and the automation electronics. For
                the power electronics we need a 12V leadacid battery, a solar panel and a solar charge controller and
                luckily for me I had thosethree components laying around from previous projects. To be specific I got
                this 12V 44Ah car batterywhich is a bit of an overkill considering that the sensor system will
                ultimately onlydraw around 24mA; but the big capacity will come in handy when later trying to power
                motors. Then I got this 10W 12V solar panel whichin combination with this generic solar charge
                controller will charge up the battery witha current of up to 0.56A. To test this I wired up the power
                electronicssystem in my garden according to this wiring diagram. Sadly though the sun didn’t feel like
                workingwith me that day but trust me when I say that later when the sun was shining, the batterywas
                charging without any problems. So next I ordered myself this wooden chestfrom the internet into which
                all the electronics will fit later on. Before putting them in there though I addeda layer of wood glaze
                to the chest in order to protect it better from the elements. Next I also created two small wood
                blocksand one big square of plywood with the help of my jigsaw. I added the two wood blocks on top of
                thechest lid with screws and then mounted the big plywood square on top of it all at anangle. And as you
                would have guessed at this point,this is the roof of my electronics housing which means I also had to
                add a bit of roofingpaper. So with the housing being completed, I gotmyself lots of this silicone wire
                with 2, 3 and 5 conductors inside which is even suitedto be mounted inside a sauna. What I did next was
                adding the solar panelto the roof with Velcro tape to which I then also secured one silicone wire
                through thehelp of wire pedestals and zip ties. I then soldered this wire directly to thesolar panel
                before I positioned the chest enclosure in front of the greenhouse. There I then drilled 4 more
                additional holesinto the chest of which I immediately used one in order to guide the solar panel
                wirethrough. Inside the chest I wired up the solar chargecontroller to the battery and solar panel like
                I described it before and just like thatthe power electronics parts was done and it was time to move on
                to the automation partstarting with this PCB I ordered from the internet. As you can see it features an
                Arduino microcontrolleras well as an RFM95 LoRa Transceiver. Besides this board we will also need
                capacitivesoil moisture sensors of which I will be using two, one on each side of the greenhouse, aswell
                as such a BME280 temperature and humidity sensor and also a LoRa Gateway like this LG02one about which
                you can also learn more in my LoRa video. The general working principle pretty muchstays the same like I
                described it in the beginning but let me add that the Arduinowill send out the data every 60s and we
                will be using LoRaWANSo what I did first was hooking up all of the sensors to the LoRa board for a
                firsttest run according to this schematic which will pretty much not change later on. You might also
                have noticed that I added anadditional 5V regulator on the power input which was definitely mandatory to
                add becausethe board apparently cannot handle 12V. But anyway the soil moisture sensor outputsan analog
                voltage from 0 to 3V depending on how moist the earth around it is. And the BME280 sensor uses an I2C
                interfaceto send over its temperature and humidity data which means we could use its datasheetto write
                proper I2C code but then again there also exists a simpler to use Arduino libraryfor it. With those
                information in mind I firstly createda simple example code that outputs all of the sensor data through
                the serial monitorand after using an FTDI breakout board hooked up to the serial interface of the LoRa
                boardand uploading the code, it seems like everything works just fine. That was the easy part though
                because nowit was time to establish the LoRaWAN connection for which I not only had to sign up on
                theThings Network site and edit the settings of the LoRa Gateway but I also had to usesome rather
                complicated code. However this process was surprisingly simpleto do because the Gateway manual describes
                in detail how to set everything up. Before uploading though I had to connect twoof the RFM95 board pins
                to two pins of the Arduino because the utilized LoRaWAN libraryrequires them. And after uploading the
                final code to theArduino LoRa board, we can see on the Things Network site that the data gets uploaded
                successfullyin HEX which converted into ASCII turns out to be our measured temperature, humidity
                andanalog values for the soil moisture sensor, awesome. That means it was time for me to design asmall
                housing for the BME280 sensor and 3D print it before I once again headed into mygarden. There I soldered
                the wires to the two soilmoisture sensors as well as the BME280 sensor and then waterproofed the soil
                sensors witha layer of nail polish. Afterwards I secured the BME280 sensor withits wire inside the
                greenhouse to the wall with wire pedestals and zip ties and pushedthe soil sensors into well the earth.
                Last but not least I drilled three holes intothe foundation of the greenhouse through which I then
                guided all the wires which ultimatelygot soldered to the LoRa board inside the chest. And as soon as the
                power wiring was also done,the first part of this project was basically complete and if we once again
                check the ThingsNetwork site you can see that everything still works fine.

          <h2>How to do Simple Home Automation with Amazon Alexa || ESP8266</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                If you own an Amazon fire tablet like me or one of the other Amazon definitely not surveillance gadgets
                Then you might be familiar wolf Alexa. It is an intelligent personal assistant Developed by Amazon which
                you can interact with verbally to, for example, set a timer or hear a funny joke Of course, there are
                more useful functions that Alexa can handle for example home automation So in this video, I will present
                you a simple way on how to control a micro-controller output with Alexa Which allows us, for example, to
                verbally turn on/off the lights and a corridor Let's get started! This video is sponsored by JLC PCB
                upload, your Gerber files to other high quality PCBs for insanely low prices and turn your designs into
                real boards to make your projects look more professional The first thing we need for the small project
                is obviously a microcontroller. I went with the popular ESP8266 Since it offers Wi-Fi and is supported
                by the Arduino IDE once we install its library through the boards manager Additionally, we need an
                electrically controllable switch which should be some kind of relay because I want to let us switch
                mains voltage with it and while we are at it, we should probably add a voltage regulator circuit for the
                microcontroller and a transistor will flyback diode for the relay But before I overcomplicate this
                project too much. Let's rather order one of those ESP8266 Relay Board it got everything we need for
                those projects. A voltage regulation circuit, A Relay with transistor and diodes as well as slots
                between its high voltage traces PCB terminals and even an Optocoupler Input as a bonus. If you want more
                details about the board Then definitely check out microcontroller experiments article about it which
                offers tons of useful information For our application though. We only need to know the GPIO pin four of
                the esp8266 Is connected to the base of the relay transistor Which means by pulling it high it activates
                the relay and by pulling it low it deactivates the relay Which is also indicated by an onboard led This
                way the change over contact of the relay which are connected to the upper three PCB terminals Can be
                used to connect our appliance to mains voltage To reprogram the microcontroller though. I sold at male
                headers to all the five solder pads in the down left corner of the PCB then I grabbed a USB to serial
                converter set to 3.3 volts and Connected its TX pin to RX, RX to TX and ground to ground Afterwards, I
                shorted the lower two pins with a jumper and connected the boards to a power supply set to at least 7
                volts With that been done it was time to program But since I'm terrible at that, I rather try to utilize
                the FouxmoESP codes Which basically emulates a Belkin WeMo device and thus lets you control the ESP8266
                through Alexa so after editing the provided example codes Choosing the right upload options and
                uploading the codes. I then remove the jumper Restart the boards and realize that no matter how often I
                search for the device with the alexa software it never found it There seems to be lots of problems with
                incompatible libraries in alexa updates So I ditched that idea and instead went with a bulletproof
                method provided by Kakopappao papa Firstly I had to create an account on Sinric, which is an IOT site
                that can connect all kinds of boards with Alexa Then I added a smart home device Which I will call
                lights and continued by downloading the example Sinric ESP8266 code from Github After unpacking, I
                opened the switch example and downloaded/included the two libraries which were mentioned in the codes
                afterwards, I added my Wi-Fi information along with the API key for my Sinric account as well as the API
                key for my light switch to the codes Here I can now tell the microcontroller what to do when the device
                is been turned on or turned off which is in my case a simple digitalWrite function and With that being
                done I uploaded this new code to the boards, added the Sinric skill to Alexa and search for new devices
                Which this time was successful At this point the voice control of the microcontroller should work
                without any problems Alexa turn on the lights (Clicks) Okay Alexa turn off the lights (Clicks) Okay That
                means we could now hook up a lamp or something similar to the relay and call it a day But I wanted to
                present you a more practical example of home automation with Alexa As you might know when it comes to
                switching on your lights then we got a pretty straightforward electrical installation We usually start
                in the distribution box where we got our fuse with the protection in place the wire then goes to a
                switch and Afterwards to the lights before it returns to the distribution box in order to complete the
                circuit So the place where we would need to add our Alexa relay is in parallel to the light switch Which
                is certainly not an easy and appropriate real life solution The good news though is that I got one light
                circuit that is different because it utilizes push button and a surge relay Which like the name implies
                is a relay that either closes/opens its contacts when other there's a current surge This way we can add
                the microcontroller with relay right next to it in the distribution box and utilize the given hat rail
                assembly So I reprogrammed my microcontroller in a way that it only activates the relay for half seconds
                to simulate the current surge Mounted the board inside a hat rail compatible enclosure and added at 24
                volts hat rail power supply to the mix Afterwards, I added the parts to my distribution box and wired
                them up But I will not go into detail here Because if you plan to add something like this to your own
                house wiring then you should always consult an expert otherwise, you could kill yourself through mains
                voltage or burn your house down And once my wiring was complete it was time for another test Alexa turn
                the lights on (Clicks) Okay Alexa turn the lights off (Clicks) Okay As you might have noticed this
                system works flawlessly But since I'm not such a big home automation enthusiast, I rather remove the
                system from my distribution box But I still hope that this example gave you lots of ideas on how to
                utilize Alexa and an esp8266 in order to control all kinds of things, but please handle mains voltage
                with care.

          <h2>Building a Digital Music Player with I2S?! What is I2S! EB#45</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                Let’s imagine you bought a microcontrollerboard like this ESP32 and you only recorded an awesome sound
                clip which looks like this:“Stay Creative!” Now in fact you would like to playback this soundwith the
                assistance of the ESP32, so what does one do? Well, the input side is pretty straightforwardby simply
                adding a micro SD card breakout board to the ESP32 through its SPI interface. because of this fast data
                line, all the bits ofthe original audio file are often read by the ESP32 without losing any audio
                quality. meaning we still got the first resolutionof 16 bits which describes in what number steps our
                original analog audio signal was digitallyconverted. As a rule of thumb, the more bits we got,the closer
                we are to the initial analog signal. Also the rate of 44.1 kHz is keptintact which describes how often
                the voltage of the analog signal got sampled; in thiscase around every 22.7uS. And all over again the
                upper the rate,the closer we ought to the important analog signal but let me tell you that 16 bits and
                44.1kHz sounds pretty good. that the input side is finished and for the outputside we could use the
                inner DAC aka Digital to Analog Converter of the ESP32 to createthe analog audio signal. But sadly it
                only comes with a resolutionof 8 bits which might act as a bottleneck for our audio quality. Instead I
                wanted to use this MAX98357A amplifierbreakout board which uses I2S to speak. So during this video we'll
                discover what I2Sis and why it's pretty handy to use and along the way we'll not only learn working
                withthe I2S amplifier board but also with an I2S microphone board. Let’s get started! This video is
                sponsored by JLCPCB, who producehigh quality PCBs for a awfully affordable price. After over 3 years of
                using their serviceI can still highly recommend it. So why not upload your Gerber files todayand receive
                your PCBs sometimes even within every week. First off, i need to mention that we don't seem to be
                forcedto use an I2S DAC Amplifier board on the output. We could also build up a 16 bit R-2R DAC butthat
                would require 16 pins of the ESP32 and thus isn't practically useable. Or we could simply get a 16 bit
                DAC IC whichwe could attach to the ESP32 through as an example I2C. then again again if we already use a
                communicationprotocol, why not use I2S which was specifically designed for audio applications. I2S
                stands for Inter-IC Sound and it's anelectrical serial bus interface used for obviously connecting
                digital audio devices. It communicates PCM audio data which standsfor Pulse-Code Modulation which could
                be a method to digitally represent sampled analog signalswhich is as an example employed by our .wav
                sound file. It basically stores the binary values of allthe sampled analog voltage values in it which is
                largely what we would like to send aroundwith I2S. For a primary practical example however let’snot set
                out with the amplifier board but instead with this INMP441 Microphone breakoutboard. With it the I2S
                concept are easier tounderstand since we only should read in data with the microphone while we'd have
                toread in data and channelise data with the micro sd card and also the amplifier board. But anyway the
                microphone features 6 pinsof which 2 are for power, 3 are for the I2S interface and one is reasonably a
                bonus to selectwhether the microphone outputs its data on the left or right channel. The three pins
                required for the I2S are calledword select, serial clock and serial data. within the case of the
                amplifier board later onthey feature slightly different names but still mean the identical thing. So as
                a primary test I soldered wires to the5 important pins and continued by having a glance at the ESP32
                pinout diagram in orderto understand where to attach the I2S pins and to my surprise there have been no
                specificpins mentioned. because it seems the ESP32 comes with two I2Speripherals but you'll be able to
                select the pins for them by yourself. So i made a decision on pins 15, 2 and 4 accordingto this
                schematic and after connecting a micro USB cable, I had a fast take a look at theI2S programming guide
                page for the ESP32. I simply copied a touch of the shown code inorder to not only set the resolution to
                16 bits and also the rate to 44.1kHz butalso to initialize and begin the I2S communication. All I had to
                feature were a pair of lines tooutput the received data through the serial monitor. And after uploading
                the code and opening theserial monitor we will see that by whistling into the microphone or tapping it,
                the serialmonitor or perhaps better the serial plotter seems to react accordingly, awesome. which means
                everything works fine and it wastime to own a glance at the three I2S pins on the oscilloscope. foremost
                we are able to see that the word selectlines constantly alter between high and low. the rationale is
                that this bus transmits stereoaudio then the low state of the word select line indicates the left
                channel and also the highstate stands for the proper channel. By the way during this example we only got
                dataon the left channel because the unconnected L/R pins defines that. Then we got the Serial Clock
                generated bythe ESP32 at whose rising edge the information of the Serial Data gets sampled. this fashion
                the audio data bits channelise by themicrophone is read by the ESP32 which is pretty standard
                communication interfaceknowledge you must know from my SPI, I2C or as an example CAN video. But what's
                special about this communicationis the frequency of the clock signal. it's actually adjustable and
                depends on thesampling rate, bit resolution and whether you wish to transmit mono or stereo.

          <h2>Which Motor Type is the Best Generator? || DC, BLDC or Stepper? (Experiment)</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                When it comes to the integration of motion in projects, then hobbyists usually have three big motor type
                options they can choose from There's the DC motor, the BLDC motor, and the stepper motor Their job is to
                convert electrical power into mechanical power by sometimes simply applying a DC voltage and Sometimes
                applying that voltage in a more complicated way If you want to learn more about the working behavior of
                such motors Then I would highly recommend you to watch my videos about the mentioned three motor types
                Anyway, what everyone probably tried out at some point was soldering an LED to the input terminals of a
                DC motor and spinning its shaft, which miraculously illuminated the LED The reason is that we reversed
                the energy flow meaning we now create electrical energy from mechanical energy and thus, use the motor
                as a generator and This brings me to the subject of this video which is about conducting a couple of
                experiments in order to find out which one of those three classical hobbyist motors is best suited as a
                generator Let's get started... [music plays] This video is sponsored by JLCPCB, which is ideal for cheap
                and fast PCB turnarounds From prototypes to high-volume productions they can do a delivery on time in
                99% of the cases So upload your Gerber files to order high quality PCBs First off why would you want to
                use a generator? Well coming from the industrial side of view, most electrical energy that we consume is
                Generated like the name implies by a generator whose shaft is spun by turbine fueled by for example gas
                or coals But coming from a hobbyist side, a generator can be useful for windmill experiments which you
                know is always fun. So, Let's imagine. We got a steady breeze and thus a constant torque on the
                generator shafts to simulate the situation, I will be using an ODrive BLDC motor With a 3d printed motor
                mount and an attached encoder to the motor shafts In combination with the fitting o drive control
                boards, this motor becomes powerful and quite versatile. Since it can be rotated very slowly, Almost
                completely silent and best of all, it can go to a position and stay there with a holding torque- Due to
                the utilization of the encoder So, all in all, the ODrive is pretty awesome But, since a more appealing
                graphical interface would be more suitable for this experiment. I would rather switch to the VESC About
                which I also talked in a previous video Now after calibrating the ODrive motor with the VESC tool I will
                be using the duty cycle control for this experiment That means that is a duty cycle and thus average
                voltage will be applied to the motor phases which, on the other hand, means that as soon as a bigger
                load gets attached to the motor the rotation speed would decrease Which would be just like attaching a
                bigger load to a constant wind force During the experiment, I will be recording the input power of the
                motor and and the output power of the generator and thus at the end calculate the efficiency of the
                whole system As a load for the three generators, I will be using 50 Ohm power resistors which are added
                to about any other components to the DC motor since it only produces a DC voltage The stepper motor, on
                the other hand, with its four wires just delivered two beautiful sinusoidal voltages Which require two
                full bridge rectifiers and capacitors in order to turn them into a DC voltage as well Last but not
                least, we got the BLDC motor which is the most complicated Since it offers 3 phase shifted, not that
                beautiful looking sinusoidal voltages But luckily the motor is configured in a star build-up which means
                we can use a "sechspuls Brückenschaltung" [3 phase rectifier] Basically a full bridge rectifier with two
                more diodes and capacitors, in order to once again, get a DC voltage on the output and with the
                electronics being completed it was time for the final step: the mechanical connection between the motor
                and the generators Now for the DC motor and the stepper motor, it was simple since I had an 8 mm to 5 mm
                shaft coupler laying around But of course, that would not fit for the BLDC motor shaft so I downloaded
                another shaft coupler from thingiverse 3d printed it, enlarged its holes to 8 mm's and mounted it onto
                the BLDC motor and With that being done. It was time for the experiment. I utilized the duty cycles 0.1,
                0.15, 0.2 and 0.25 and like stated before, recorded the input power of the motor and the output voltage
                of the generator across the resistor Since we know the exact value of it, we can later easily calculate
                the output power But nevertheless, what stood out to me while recording the values was that the DC motor
                as a generator Was rather loud and vibrated a lot during operation The stepper motor on the other hand
                rotated the smoothest and the BLDC motor was a mix of both the previous generators and with the values
                being recorded it was time for the evaluation Now, the output power of the BLDC was the lowest While the
                DC and stepper motor were able to output about the same at four point something watts The average
                efficiency of the DC motor and the stepper motor was around 20-30% Which is acceptable if you consider
                that we included losses from the VESC, the motor, the mechanical connection, the generator, and the
                rectifier and also, we did not have a variable load on the outputs But what was definitely not
                acceptable was the efficiency of the BLDC motor which was at four percent at best Which brings us to the
                question: what is going on here? For that, let's look at the DC motor whose model number tells us that
                it is a gear DC motor With an RPM of 85 at 12 volts and a gear ratio of 1 to 86 In Case you don't know,
                a gearbox like it's attached on top of the DC motor Consists of.. you guessed it... Gears Their job is
                in this case to decrease the rotation speed of the motor, but increase its torque That means without the
                gears the DC motor would have rotated with an RPM of around 7310 and was easily rotatable by hand But
                with the gears the RPM decreased to 85 and the shaft was no longer easily rotatable Due to the increased
                torque What I'm trying to say Is that the DC motor did only work so well as a generator because the gear
                system increased its rotation speed significantly Now, looking over to the poorly behaving BLDC motor,
                and we realized that the gear system Would have increased its rotation speed and performance
                significantly as well since this one is rated for 270kV we would need an RPM of 270 to get an
                approximate 1 volt output voltage Which basically means we need in higher rpm to get useful voltage?
                Which the wind force will definitely not deliver, but the gearbox could do that The stepper motor, on
                the other hand, did work so well due to its motor construction which is primarily intended for lower rpm
                tasks (ex. 3D printing) Simplified speaking, fast rotating motors need gearbox when used as a hobbyist
                generator which brings me to the conclusion of this experiment DC motors are the worst option Because
                due to the construction they mostly require: a high RPM, Not rotate well enough, and have lots of
                mechanical wear off due to the carbon brushes If you want it simple and not worry about much, then go
                with the stepper motor since it can be used even without a gearbox, rotates well, and outputs enough
                power for fun little projects and if you want it professional, but complicated, then go for the BLDC
                motor with a suitable gearbox since they are mechanically the best and are able to output lots of power.
                If you go for the right ones and with that being said, I hope you enjoyed my small experiments.

                Now we try to do this work once again. first we keep both spindles activated. Then we move the spindle
                to a new start point when it's almost close to the surface we change the mode from continous to step So
                it'll move 0.1mm every time you press the button Or we can use particular distance to control the moving
                we enter 3 here Then we press [Z-] and it'll go down 3mm once at a time Seems I still need to move it a
                bit. I switch to step mode so now both spindles are OK. Now press [Z-&gt;0] to define the start height
                switch to continue mode Then lift Z upward disable spindle 1 and keep spindle 2 activated. press [X-] to
                move spindle 2 left (closer to spindle 1) now activate 1 and turn off 2 move spindle 1 to the right
                activate them both press [XY-&gt;0] to define the start point press [origin] Press [run] to run a file
                from USB disk find the G code file I made in artcam pres [OK] here we can change the work speed and
                moving speed if you want to change it you press [run] I change it a bit lower spdscale means the
                starting speed. usually we make it less than 0.5 Press [OK] again the machine will start working now the
                machine is running at 20% of 8m/min = 1.6m/min we can use the [Y+] to release the speed to full
                speed(8m/min) OK, now the work finisthed with this machine we can define the distance of the 2 spindles
                very easily we can move spindle 2 to the end of X axis and use spindle 1 only, to achive larger work
                space just as a normal single head cnc router Now I moved spindle 2 the the end of X axis Only activate
                spindle 1 so we can move spindle 1 only And use it as single head cnc router the machine can run in high
                speed to finish your work fast

          <h2>CNC Machine Electrical Wiring Complete!</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                The final parts arrived to finish the electrical panel- I got themall installed and I'm gonna go over
                what it took to get to this point. I orderedin some shorter Ethernet cables to connect the Ether1616 and
                the Acornboard to the switch. I'm trying to eliminate having a lot of excess wirecoiled up in the bottom
                of the electrical cabinet. These are shieldedcables and should work out pretty well. I also decided to
                add in some circuitbreakers on the 24 volt DC power lines our Allen-Bradley distributoraccidentally sent
                them to me a while ago and just told me to keep them- so they'vebeen sitting around ever since. since I
                had two of these breakers on hand Iended up splitting the 24 volt supply into two different circuits one
                forinside the electrical panel and a separate circuit to feed stuff outsidethe electrical panel. This
                will be for things like cooling fans on the steppermotors. I needed to make up the interface cable to
                attach the DYN4 AC servo drive to the Centroid Acorn. I built this up following a drawing I received
                from DMM This was fairly straightforward only things slightly fiddly about it wasadding a pull-up
                resistor between two of the pins originally I was going to use this DINrail mount pull-up resistor but I
                ended up not having a really good place on theelectrical panel to put it. And since this resistor is
                going to be hiddeninside the DB25 connector shell it should make for a fairly neatinstallation I'm going
                to be using one input on the Acorn to receive the servo alarm signal from the DYN4 I'll also be using
                the analog output to controlthe servo speed, plus two digital outputs- one for motor direction and
                another as aservo enable signal when I use small wires like this on electrical panels,I like to jacket
                it to keep it neat The easiest way I found to do this is withthe same cable insulation I stripped off. I
                just slip pieces of the insulationback onto the cable, fanning out the various wires where I need them,
                and thena bit of heat shrink tubing to hold everything in place now I don't alwaysuse crimp on ferrules,
                but I do like them on smaller wires like this 24 gaugestuff I'm using here I will have links down in the
                video description to thiscrimping tool as well as the other products used in this video. So if you'dlike
                to learn more about anything you see here, check out down there -or- feelfree to ask about it down in
                the comment section. The final additions to the panel involvethe power wires for the DYN4 AC servo
                drive. The contactor and line filterarrived this week and I got them installed The contactor breaks the
                220volt supply feeding the servo drive. this will be controlled by the E-stop circuit. The line filter
                is on the incoming AC control voltage for the drive. I added a piece of DIN rail underneath the DYN4 and
                I rerouted some of the wiring tomake it all fit. There's a hole in the electrical panelthat I've been
                avoiding, but when I went back to check my notes I realized itwasn't used for anything, so I ended up
                burying it underneath these components. This machine will run on 220 volts ACand all of the AC voltage
                wires tie into the terminal blocks in the lower rightcorner of the electrical panel. A bit later in this
                video I'm gonna beshowing an overview of how the various voltages are distributed on this paneland
                isolated from each other so you might want to stick around for that With the electrical panel taken care
                of,I needed to start working on the enclosure. I've been waiting for warm weather for quite a while to
                be able to take it outside to paint. seems like the weatherman lied to me though- I had a one day window
                to paint, but the temperaturenever got up to where it was supposed to. I did use the day however to wash
                off thedirt and grease but the paint had to wait. Fortunately I have access to a shopthat does have a
                room for painting and I was able to use that to get the paint done You may notice the burn marks where
                thebottom of this cabinet had to be tack welded back together. When I receivedthis machine, all those
                welds were cracked and the cabinet had collapsed onitself. This is one of those things I had taken care
                of before I started thisvideo series, so unfortunately no video footage exists. It took two cans of what
                Rust-oleumcalls their High Performance Enamel. The advantage of that is that it's fastdrying so I was
                able to take it home after only a few hours of waiting I got the enclosure back home, got itmounted back
                up on the mill, and I reunited it to the electrical panel.These two haven't seen each other for over a
                year or two. let's take a momentand discuss the general layout of this electrical cabinet and the things
                that Iwas keeping in mind as I was setting it up. As I mentioned before, the machine isgoing to run on
                220 volts AC. that's largely because of the requirements ofthe DYN4 AC servo drive. The voltage is going
                to come into the terminal blocksin the lower right corner of the cabinet it's gonna feed the 24 volt DC
                powersupply and then go up the side to provide voltage for both the 48 volt DCpower supply and the DYN4
                AC servo drive. This is going to keep the highvoltage as far removed from all the other components as
                much as possible. Stepping down in voltage, we have the 48 volt power supply which is providing voltage
                to the G251X Gecko Drives. And then the output from the Gecko Drivesfeeds down to terminal blocks in the
                bottom of the cabinet where they willeventually hook to the stepper motors. We come out of the top of
                the 24 volt powersupply and feed our circuit breakers. And then coming out of the bottom of that,
                wesplit off and feed two different banks of terminal blocks- one of those beingearmarked for connections
                inside the cabinet, while the other is forconnections outside the cabinet. And then finally we branch
                off to feed theCentroid Acorn and the Centroid Ether1616 Expansion board. Since our outputmodules are
                all relay based, we could really be switching almost any sort of voltage- but typically we're going to
                be switching 24 volts DC. These outputscould be a bit noisy because typically we're going to be
                switching inductiveloads like relays or air valves so I'm trying to keep them as far away from the
                inputs as possible And then finally we have our DC inputs. On the Acorn system, these can be anything
                from 5 to 24 volts. typically we'll be running 24 volts andI'm keeping them all to the far left side of
                the cabinet, away from everythingelse as much as possible, just to avoid any sort of interference. so
                where does this leave us?Well I have all the wiring to run from the electrical cabinet out to themill. I
                currently have the existing corrugated plastic conduits soaking in the purple power degreaser. I also
                need to replace a piece of missing sheet metal it's a C channel 3" x 6" that runsbetween the back of the
                mill and in the front of the electrical cabinet it covers the counterweight but it also provides some
                support for the the top of the cabinet. It's a fairly simple piece, but I don't haveany sheet metal
                equipment- so that's something I may have to farm out. I plan on mounting thecomputer here in the
                electrical cabinet so I've ordered some bulkhead connectorsthat'll allow me to pass the USB and HDMI
                signals from the computer to theoutside world. I'm contemplating a small design change to the spindle
                motor adapter plate so for those of you keeping score this will berevision number 5. I'm also missing
                one of these stepper motor covers, so I'm planning on trying to 3d print that. I think as long as I put
                it up on thez-axis where it doesn't get touched, the 3d printing should be fine. Every axis, the spindle
                motor, as well as the electrical cabinet has fans and I'veordered replacements for all of those Then I
                need to come up with some sort ofarm to hold the monitor and possibly a keyboard. Every one I've seen is
                toobouncing and I don't like using them. And, I need to run 220 volts over behind the wall on this
                machine. so I'll be working on all that this week, if you have asuggestion for a stable monitor arm, let
                me hear about it down in the commentsand if you'd like to see how this project started out click that
                link overto the left and I will see you over there

          <h2>Centroid Acorn / DynaMyte Mill Retrofit- Rounding 3rd Headed For Home</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                Continuing on our work with theDynaMyte 2800 CNC retrofit. Checked quite a few items
                off of our punch list this week and had a few failures along the way. I'm gonna be sharing that with
                you. Hey, It's Pete.Welcome back to the workshop First item I checked off the list this weekwas the
                counterweight cover. As I mentioned last time, that wassomething I did have to farm out. Drew up the
                drawing in fusion 360 Sent the drawing offto a local fabrication house. 20 dollars later they returned
                the piece to me and all I had to do was paint it. Before putting it on the mill, I did haveto drill and
                tap out some of the holes. Some of the threads werea little bit messed up so I drilled them a little bit
                deeper and got a bottoming tap so that Icould get in there. hopefully give me a few more threads to
                catch on to. This red paint that I'm using is a krylon color I've never been able to find a goodmatch
                for the original DynaMyte paint. It almost has a slight pinkish tint to it. Now the purpose of this
                cover as I said it's the counterweight cover, but moreimportantly than that, it actually provides some
                support for the electrical cabinet. Right now the electrical cabinet is only supported at the bottom and
                thecabinet itself can rock quite a bit. There's actually a clip that goes on theback of the electrical
                cabinet that holds the cabinet to the counterweightcover and it really ties the entire machine together
                The next thing on the list were the fanson the rear door of the electrical enclosure Now these fans,
                like the restof the fans in the DM2800, all originally operated at 110 volts AC. And I was not crazy
                about sending the 110 volt AC line out to every one of the axes. so I swapped the stepper motor and
                spindle motor fans for 24 volt versions,and ran all new wiring out to all of them. On the back door
                though I wasn't soconcerned about it, so I stayed with 110 volt fans back there. I'd like to take just a
                moment to discuss the trajectory of this particular project. This has beenstretching on for a while now
                and I know that some of you are very interested tosee this thing make its first chips and truthfully
                nobody's more interested inseeing that than I am. I have been taking my time with this project and one
                of the reasons for that is because I really want this to come out nicely and I know myself, I know that
                if I race through this, and there's little dangling thingsthat aren't quite right- once I put the
                machine back into operation, I'll probably never go back and revisit those things and take care of them.
                And they'll just end up being a source of annoyance for the rest of my life OR for at leastas long as I
                own the machine. Truthfully this project is going kind ofslow but prior to starting this channel this
                projects been creeping on for sixyears now so, in retrospect we're making great progress now. Next item
                to tackle were some of theopenings on the outside of the electrical cabinet. On the left-hand side of
                the cabinet, there's a square opening for an AC outlet. This outlet wasoriginally for the coolant pump
                and the original outlet that was in this spot was broken- there was a spring clip on the back of it that
                had cracked and wasno longer usable. I was just getting ready to order a new one from Amazonwhen I
                realized that I probably had one in stock. I mentioned in an earlier videohow a local hardware store had
                gone out of business a few years ago, and I wentto the auction and purchased rather large quantity of
                containers and parts bins. I wanted these tip out bins for storage in my own shop, but they came with
                all the parts that were originally in them I sorted through the containerand came up with a black one
                and a white one. Directly below the AC outlet weretwo fuse-holders. One of these was the original
                incoming AC fuse it was rated at 10 amps. And then there was a 1 amp fuse that fed the adapter board for
                the brushless DC servo drive. I'll be putting fuse holdersin both of these, although I don't know
                specifically what I'm gonna be using them for. Finally on the lefthand side of the electrical cabinet I
                remounted the automatic lubricator I cleaned this up it does function but I am gonna need to find some
                new line tofeed the lubrication manifold in the machine moving to the right hand side ofthe machine,
                there were two spots where 5-pin din connectors were originallymounted. One of these was labeled 'IO
                Sync' and the other was a tool probe. I'm goingto replace both of these with a 5 pin aviation style
                connector, again I'm notsure exactly what we'll be using them for. But it will fill the hole and itwill
                give me something for future expansion. I went ahead and decided to change allthe wiring going out to
                the stepper motors. Originally it was an 8 conductorwire of a very fine gauge. I decided to switch to a
                4 conductor wire of a heavier gauge, and in the process then changed all the connectors as well. Instead
                of the small JST style connector that was originally on there, I went with a more automotive type of
                connector with a seal in it. This is probably not 100% necessary, but I figured down the line if we want
                to switch to alarger stepper drive, for a direct drive connection to the lead screw, it'll give me more
                current handling capability. Plus I don't exactly know the status of theoriginal wires whether there
                could be any breaks inside them or not anyways. I made up stepper motor cablesets for all three axes.
                While I was at it I also replaced the wiresgoing out to all of the fans on the stepper motor as well as
                the spindle motor. The connectors didn't match the new fans to the old wires, so I figured while I was
                at it, I might as well just replace them. I tend to use a lot of fluxwhen I solder and part of that is
                just a byproduct of the way I normally solderhere in the shop. I use lead-free solder and I do a lot of
                hand soldering ofsurface mount components. when you do that you really need to add the extra flux to be
                able to do that. so it's just a habit I got into of always adding flux. Or you could just say that maybe
                I'm a student of the Louis Rossmann school offlux application. Although the soldering was a bit
                fiddly,it's something I do every day so it wasn't that big a deal Really the hardest part of all of
                thiswas fishing all of the new cables down through the flexible conduit. Every flexible conduit has a
                stepper motor cable, a 24 volt power supply cable for the fan, and a 2 conductor cable going out to the
                end of travel switch for that axis. ... And then there's my one-handed soldering technique for putting
                the newconnectors on the motors as they're still mounted to the machine. I will have links down in the
                video description to the tools and products I used in this video. One issue I did run into is we were
                missing some of the nutsfor these flexible conduit connectors. I ended up having to call the3D printer
                into service again to print up some new nuts for me. I went ahead and hooked up the powerwires leading
                up to the fans on the rear door the electrical enclosure. Feeding the wires into thespindle motor
                conduit , there were four of them total- The motor power wire,the encoder for the motor, as well as the
                24 volt power supply for the fan, and a fourth wire -which I believe is a 5 volt supply that feeds the
                digital readout on thefront of the DynaMyte that indicates the current speed of the machine. The Z-axis
                is actually where we had oneof our failures this week, the original 3d printed case that I hadprinted to
                cover the motor, when I went to put it on it didn't fit. And I don't know whathappened there, I don't
                know if it was our acetone smoothing that caused thecase to shrink slightly, or exactly what
                happened.Because I know at one point intime it did fit. so I went back to Fusion 360, and I made a
                couple modifications totweak a couple hole locations that were just passable, but maybe not a
                hundredpercent. and I reprinted that cover. I'm gonna throw up a quick time lapse hereof hooking up some
                of the wiring that we've run in. It'll be the stepper motor wires, as well as the 24 volt DC fan motor
                wires Hey if you want to follow this projectalong from the very beginning or- pick it up at any point
                along the way, click that playlist over to the left, and I will catch you over there.

          <h2>Harbor Freight Storage Bin Case Organizer- Econo Sortimo one day build</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                I've got a lot of great projects coming up, but before I can getto them I've got to
                organize this shop a bit my shop is limited on space as longas everything is in its place there's no
                problems but once a project starts andthings start getting moved around it starts getting tight real
                fast. I've beenusing these Harbor Freight storage cases for a number of years- I really like them.you
                can mix and match bins between the cases to get just the configuration youwant for the parts you're
                trying to store. They're great value for the moneyat the time of this recording they regularly go on
                sale every couple ofmonths for $5.99 you can find a coupon the problem is I don't have a good wayof
                storing them right now I've got them stacked two rows deep under my workbenchand it doesn't matter which
                project I'm working on it seems like the case Ialways need is in the back row on the bottom At the
                corner of my workbench Ihave a spot that really can't be used it's up against the wall and between
                mytool chest and it just ends up being a catch-all spot for assorted things. Rightnow my bench grinder
                and my sander is living there but I can't even use themin that spot. I've got 36 inches of height
                available in this area and I'mgonna try to use every bit of it. going to go for something that will hold
                twostacks of cases and space for up to 14 cases in each stack. I'm gonna takeadvantage of the nice
                weather today set the table saw outside under a shade treeand see if we can't knock this project out in
                a day. going to be using 3/4 inch plywood forthe sides and the center divider they will be the full
                height of 36 inchesand 13 1/2 inches deep the center divider is going to fitwithin the unit so it only
                needs to be 35 by 13 for the top and bottom pieces switchingto half-inch plywood and they're gonna be 34
                by 13 1/2 There are a lot of ways this could have been assembled I've got a project coming up where
                I'mgoing to need to use pocket screws so I figured I'd get some practice using themon this project but
                this could just as easily if not even easier been puttogether with screws from the outside or staples or
                tacked or however you want itto do it I'm going to be dadoing in the shelves sowe're gonna set the dado
                for quarter inch wide and a quarter inchdeep Shelves are gonna go every two and ahalf inches The first
                dado on each of the outside pieces is at the three inchmark to account for the material thickness of the
                bottom. Then it's just a matter of adjusting and cutting and adjusting and cutting all the shelf slots
                on both sides center divider doesn't need to accountfor any thickness so it starts at two and a half
                inches and is cut on bothsides For the assembly going to use theTitebond glue here to get a quick set up
                and one-inch pocket screws and then nearing the end here we cut ahalf inch piece of plywood 34 by 35
                this is going to be inset from the back finishing up cutting 24 shelves from1/4" plywood all those dado
                cuts release some stressin the plywood and cause the sidewalls to bend out. I address this by drilling
                ahole in the center shelf slot and running a quarter inch threaded rod fromend to end this requires the
                center shelf to be split in half - one half is going to be on each side of the rod, but it adds an
                incredible amount of stiffness to therack and it doesn't interfere with the shelves finally the back was
                installed this wasglued and screwed in place then a coat of stain to seal the grainand the project was
                done I'm happy with how this project turnedout but just like every project there's things about it I
                would like to change.for instance the center divider, they could have been dadoed in. At the end ofthe
                day I think Harbor freights missing an opportunity here. it seems like everycouple weeks somebody on
                YouTube is mentioning watching the Adam Savagevideo about his Sortimo System lamenting the cost of how
                expensive theyare and then going on to build something similar that uses the Harbor Freightcases. Now
                this project was a means to an end for me I just wanted to clean up myshop so I could get to more
                elaborate projects had I been able to go directlyto Harbor Freight and buy a similar rack maybe made out
                of metal for $150 or lessI probably just would have done that and then

          <h2>Lathe Turret Tailstock Restoration</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                so I actually found Church key today soI don't have to use a screwdriver to open this
                paint can. I know here inPennsylvania we call these church keys is that a universal term though? I
                neverreally thought about it. let me know in the comments. hey it's Pete welcome backto my workshop.
                This week I'm continuing on with the restoration of the turrettail stock for the Clausing-Colchester
                lathe. There's a lot to be done so I'mgonna get right into it I got quite a few parts that need to
                bede-rusted so I'm just gonna throw them into this container of Evapo-Rust and I'mtrying to throw in as
                many things as I can find because I don't have quiteenough to fill this container so I'm trying to raise
                the level by justthrowing extra stuff in. Alright, in the interest of doing a nice job here, I want to
                remove the ball oilers so I can finish the surface here. unfortunately,there doesn't appear to be any
                way to get these ones out without actuallydamaging them- at least no way that I could discover. The
                problem is thatthe bore does not go the whole way through. so there's no way to punch themout from the
                backside. so I can put a smaller punch in, but that has the effectof knocking the ball out. of course
                destroying the oiler. so we're going to have to buy new ones if we run a tap down inside of it, I canuse
                that to pull it out with. there we go, do you see that bottomed out? And nowit'll take..... I can pull
                it right out. Now I just have to get that off the end of mytap. alright before we go any further I just
                want to do a quick test on this tosee if we might have any lead paint contained here. that's gonna let
                me knowwhat I have to do as far as disposal goes whether I have to take any specialprecautions or not.
                I've got these lead test swabs and all you have to do withthese is dip them in white vinegar and that
                will activate them and then you rubthem over the surface that you want to test and you then observe the
                colorchange and if it goes to a pink or red or violet here, that indicates that thereis lead presence so
                we're just gonna do a quick test so wait for this to changecolor- it starts off as an amber color and
                then you just- you're supposed to rubit on the surface for 30 seconds. alright and then we look at it
                and I'm notseeing any appreciable change here at all. It still has the pretty much thesame amber color
                it started with so I think we're fairly safe here which isgood because it means I can actually do some
                sanding and I don't have to worryso much about what happens to the dust and also I have a lot of paint
                that hadstripped off of this when this was soaking in the purple power so I've gotall that residue
                laying in the bottom of that container and it's gonna mean it'sa lot easier to dispose of that as well
                yeah this is this is not doing anything I really am impressed with this stuff I can't get over the
                surprise I feel everytime when I pull a part out and it's completely removed the rust but hasn'tappeared
                to damage the metal in any way I remember the days of slatheringsomething down with naval jelly and
                attacking it with a wire brush or anynumber of other means of trying to get the rust off. This is just
                likepractically magic to me based on the number of marks here from set screws onetwo three four I am NOT
                the first person to get inside this thing. this is thecentral post that the turret rotates around I'm
                going to clean it up a littlebit and then we're going to apply the Ox-pho blue solution to it. That's
                going torestore the black finish to it. I'll buff it down with steel wool and then give it a coat of oil
                just to restore the sheen to it now that these parts have all beenfreshly de-rusted I want to get some
                paint on them before they start rustingup again. to be truthful I'm not a hundred percent sold on this
                color it is growing on me but I feel like I'd like it to be maybe a shade or two darker in reality it is
                darker in person than it appears on video I'm not going to bothercleaning this paint brush I'm just
                gonna do this....... and I'll still be able to use that tomorrow the posts that lock the tools in place
                have a bit of a problem in addition to not looking very nice they're also a little bit damaged. whether
                it was through just the years of use or over clamping, the lower lip ofthe clamping surface has been
                deformed a little bit. This makes it difficult toput the posts down in the turret as well as getting the
                tools to slide in freely I'm gonna spin them up on the lathe andhit them with a combination of
                scotch-brite and a file to try to get themcleaned up a little bit cleaning up the top of the tool
                poststhey're still hammered on pretty good. I think my plan here is I'm gonna put themback in the lathe,
                give them a skim just to give a clean surface there, and thenI'm gonna re-stamp the numbers I had a
                little bit of anxiety while Iwas stamping these and one of them I had to put back in the lathe and skim
                itagain, just to give it a second try but overall I'm really happy with the waythese look and how they
                came out especially when you compare them to theoriginal stampings that are on the top of the turret.
                there's at least twostampings that you can see were double struck from the factory so I've beengiving
                some thought to how I want to handle these posts that lock the toolsin place I really do like the bright
                finish after machining these off and restamping them but I don't think it's realistic, at least in my
                shop, for themto stay looking like this for any length of time. Some of my machines I don'ttouch for
                months at a time and I just think long-term at some point in timeI'm gonna neglect these and they're
                gonna start rusting up so I've decided Ithink I'm gonna go ahead and apply bluing compound to the whole
                thing herewhat I want to do is I'm gonna dip them basically to try to get as even coverageas possible
                and see how that goes before I do that I want to brush the threadswith alcohol and clean any remaining
                oil that may be down in the bottom of thethread and we'll go from there there's actually quite a bit of
                dirtdown in the root of these threads once you pour the Ox-pho Blue out of thebottle you're really not
                supposed to put it back in so what I intend to do, I havethis piece of PVC plumbing here this is
                actually a plug for inch-and-a-quarterfittings and I bought it because it perfectly fits the size here
                so I'mgonna be able to put the absolute minimum amount of the Ox-pho Bluesolution in there and not waste
                any so that's my plan at this point. first Ithink what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fill this with alcohol
                to figure outexactly how much I need to put in it and that will give me a reference for howmuch Ox-pho
                Blue to put in it because the isopropyl alcohol is obviously muchcheaper than the Ox-pho Blue is. I also
                don't want to get it on the shaftso I really just want to come up just to the washer okay so that's
                about theright amount and it's not much at all it's probably not more than a quarter ofan inch inside of
                that container. alright let's give this a first try and see ifmy idea is going to work just coming up to
                the washer there alright let's see what this does I'm really pleased with how well thispipe fitting
                is..... fitting. that's a bit redundant. I don't think thecamera can focus on this but I'm using just
                it, it's just a little over maybe a-it's not even a quarter of an inch on the bottom there I think it
                justperfectly displaces that and comes up right even with the washer the last one it's looking pretty
                good let's give itanother visit to the dunk tank I think two rounds through the dunk tank shouldmake
                them look pretty good Alright, and let's see how our ourpaintbrush is doing This has actually been a
                couple days so we'll see if this is still usable this is a just a cheap $2.00 paintbrushfrom Harbor
                Freight so I was certainly not going to spend the time cleaning it so it's actually been probably about
                3 days since I just originallywrapped this paintbrush up in my gloves and sealed it up that way and it's
                stillperfectly usable mostly I just want to do this center hub here. and I'm not going tobother taping
                anything up here I'm just going to paint this and try to be asneat as possible but any overage after
                this dries I'm just going to put it inthe lathe and clean off any of the paint both in the bore and
                around theperimeter. alright, last thing I want to do tonight before going in is to put some CitriStrip
                on this now that we know we're dealing with paint that doesn't have lead in it. give this a coat of the
                CitriStrip and let it do its job if any gets on the workbench that's okayit needs to be repainted
                anyways well I guess that's good enough for now so about 12 hours have gone by I was actually kind of
                concerned that itwasn't gonna do anything, but it actually did pretty well here. so, this stuff
                hereseemed like it was fairly impenetrable but it actually worked out pretty well.so we're gonna scrape
                this off, and we'll get on to the next thing I think what wemight be seeing here is some evidence of the
                original body work that was done onthis because that... that, it feels different It's almost like a
                putty Now I'm not concerned about taking this down to bare metal, that's not necessary.All we need to do
                is get a smooth finish we'll do maybe some filling in here justto cover up some of the roughness and
                then we'll be good to go Alright I'm gonna let that dry, thenwe'll do some sanding on it, we'll apply a
                little glazing compound in some ofthese rough areas to fill cracks and things and then we'll paint it
                Alright, I'm going to mix up a little bit of this metal glaze. This stuff you just squeezeout however
                much you want and then what you're supposed to do forthe hardener is just squeeze out a bead... (I'll
                move this up where you can see it) from one end of the puddle to the other and then mix that in till
                it's a consistentcolor I've got links down in the video description to all the tools and products that I
                use in these videos. If you want to check them out they're down there. The first coat you're supposed to
                put on and really press it into thesurface you can always go back and add more. you want to make sure
                you getinto all the nooks and crannies there and this is not for filling big holes.This is literally
                called a metal glaze it's somewhat self-leveling I think before I mix any more up to do the remainder of
                this I'm gonna let thisstuff fully cure so that I can sand it and see just what kind of finish we
                canexpect to get out of it Alright we've got the body filler herepretty well smoothed out prior to
                priming. Now we have to sand it withabout 320 grit sandpaper. this will just be a quick go over here and
                we give it acoat of primer and that will reveal any little imperfections that we can't seedue to this
                mottled surface. Once everything is all one continuous color,it will be much easier to spot our
                imperfections. Alright, I'm gonna getthis wiped off and then taped up and bring you back for the
                priming. Alright, I got this thing all cleaned up and taped up. and I'm gonna use this primeron. I
                haven't tried this stuff before this is a Custom Coat from Custom Shop. We did the 320 sanding I wiped
                it down with alcohol taped it up and now we'regoing to try this. this is supposed to be a high build
                primer Well this video is stretching on a bitlong this week and need to call it an end here at some
                point. I didn't get asfar as I had hoped to. Next week I'm not sure if we're gonna be continuing on with
                this project or if we're gonna be switching back to the Centroid retrofit. now that the holidays are
                over hopefully some of my vendors are going to get backto me with some concrete answers on some
                questions I have about possible spindleretrofit so that's about it for this week and as always please
                like sharesubscribe and I'll catch you next week

          <h2>Workshop Hardware Storage Harbor Freight Case Mods</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
             welcome back to the workshop. So I've been doing some spring cleaning around the
                shop trying toorganize my hardware &amp; parts better by standardizing and consolidating the waythat I
                store them and along the way I came up with an idea that allows me tomake the Harbor Freight storage
                cases that much more versatile and allowed meto get rid of all these. I'm gonna share that with you
                next. So if you've seen my previous videos, it's no secret that I'm a fan of these Harbor Freight
                storagecases. I really like them for mixing and matching and saving parts. But one of the things that is
                a problm with them is that there's only three sizes of insertsavailable in these cases. They come with a
                small size which is like this righthere and then a medium size which is twice the small size. And then
                we have a large size which is 4 x the little one or twice the big one. The problem with these is that
                this isn't always enough. Sometimes you have things that are long and narrow that that won't fit in any
                of these. or sometimes you have something that's just a little bit bigger than this so you have to jump
                up to these and then you're wasting a whole lot of space. So what I started thinkingabout doing was if I
                used my 3d printer I could potentially just make cases ofmy own. So if you examine the top of the case
                you'll notice all these index markswhich allow you to put any one of these small bins really anywhere in
                the caseand it will lock in place. So the entire grid is based off of these smaller onesand that lends
                itself to the idea, "Well as long as you make inserts that aremultiples of that size there you could
                make bins that would fit in this case ofany size you'd like". So I grabbed a couple quick dimensions off
                of one of the existing inserts, just the the width and the depth of the the top rim. Iguessed at the
                radiuses in the corners. and then measured the heights as welland was able to build up a model from
                there. Did a little bit of work andredesigned the feet for the bottom and then after the model was
                complete I sentthe whole thing off to simplify 3d where I sliced it up and then sentto my printer. Now
                my printer is fairly heavily modified, I've taken all the electronics off of the printer itself and
                moved them outside of an enclosurethat I've put around the printer. That allows me to completely seal
                the printerup which is important if you want to print ABS. It prevents drafts fromgetting into the
                printer which can cause the print to warp and by moving theelectronics outside that prevents the
                electronics from overheating in thatenclosed space. Inside the space itself it can get up to about 50
                degreesCelsius just by being enclosed so it took a couple hours to print, that couldprobably be
                optimized. I tend to go a little bit heavier on the infill than Iprobably would need to, and add a
                little bit more detail than I probably wouldhave to have but overall I'm happy with the results. The
                first thing I did wasactually to create the mid size bin, now there's really probably no reason toprint
                this bin because they're available in the cases now. There is a coupledifferences though between this
                and the stock bin. The feet on these are just alittle bit bigger which allows them to fit nicer actually
                into the bottom ofthe case- also because these are 3d printed rather than being injectionmolded, there's
                no taper to the side so it makes the internal volume just everso slightly larger so once I had this, I
                went back to fusion 360 and because it's a parametric based CAD system I could change one dimension and
                have the entiremodel changed for me and that allowed me to create the smaller bin with just onechange of
                a dimension and that came out really well so I started trying my theory out of making other sizes for
                instance one that would be a size and ahalf here I created that. And then I created one that's basically
                four of thesmaller ones- now this one here in reality has the same internal volume asthe stock one that
                comes with the Harbor Freight case but it's in a differentform factor so if you have something that's
                long and narrow it'll fit betterin this then obviously it wouldn't fit at all in this and then from
                there Iwent on to create an even larger piece so I have an underlying belief thattools and their
                hardware or consumables should not be stored together. I don'tthink it makes any sense to, for instance,
                store my screwdrivers inside of mycontainer of screws. I don't always use them together. Sometimes I
                just need ascrewdriver to go remove a screw from something else. It wouldn't make sensefor me to have to
                dig out my parts container and dig through the screwcontainer to find the screwdriver I wanted
                occasionally though I think thereis a case where the tool and it's consumablesshould be stored together
                and that's when you have a single function tool-something like my wire crimpers- I think it makes sense
                to store the wirecrimpers with your crimp-on terminals because you're never gonna use onewithout the
                other. Now when I'm working in my shop, one of the things I like to do is just fix what bothers me and
                what's been bothering me lately is mystack of Kreg jig tools and screws these are all in their own
                individual casesand they sit in a pile under my workbench and they're always falling over. so this
                seemed like a good thing to try to put into one of these cases there were a couple problems though,
                there's a large tool like this the clamp and that's not necessarily a problem we can use the Kaizen foam
                trick that I did in. a previous video and just make an insert for that to sit down in what was abigger
                problem though is the the tool itself. so the tool has the the jig andsome a driver bit as well as this
                drill bit and the problem comes right herewith this drill bit, there's a built-in gauge in this case
                that shows you how toset this set collar on the bit for different depths- now that's not ahundred
                percent needed, you can figure it out without that. but it is a nicefeature to have and I wouldn't be
                able to do that with just Kaizen Foam. sowhat I thought I would do is take a couple dimensions here go
                back to fusion360, use one of my new insert sizes and try to build something that these thingswould fit
                in so what I came up with was this guy right here it's basically thissize here that I created. It has
                room for the drill bit and the driver as wellas the Allen wrench in here, and the best part of all
                though, is it preserves thefunctionality of this little gauge right here so my new case insert holds the
                driverbit and the drill bit as well as the Allen wrench and then the jig itselffits in one of my other
                sized cases. Of course that just leaves cutting apiece of Kaizen Foam for the clamp. I don't know what I
                was doing there. I like to put masking tapeon the foam when I'm cutting it to size. I find it helps me
                lay out the initialdimensions better with this tool not being flat Iinitially have to mark out an area
                and dig a recess so that I can set the tooldown in to be able to trace around it better if you're
                curious about any of the toolsor parts that I'm using I will share links to them down in the
                videodescription now obviously I am NOT a cabinetmakerand this is not a huge collection of Kreg
                accessories. If I was doing cabinetmaking all the time I would need a much bigger collection, this
                wouldn't work forme. but just being a guy out tinkering in his shop, I think this is gonna work outjust
                fine now I have found there is a slight ridgeon these handles, so before applying a label, I always just
                take the edge of arazor blade and scrape it across it, just to remove that ridge before placing the
                label on there. so I'm slowly filling up the parts cases in my organizer and I have a few in there that
                don't have labels on yet those ones, some of themare empty, and some of them are just confused. They
                haven't really spoken tome yet- to tell me what they are. they're a collection of oddball parts
                andhaving trouble figuring out exactly what the label is that's gonna make itclearer for me to remember
                what's in that case I hope you got some value fromthis maybe picked up an idea or two you can use in
                your own shop. I really thinkthe addition of those extra sizes is gonna make those Harbor Freight cases
                somuch more versatile. and if you'd like to see how I built this cabinet to hold the cases click that
                link over to the left and I will see you over there

          <h2>CNC Mill Retrofit- Wiring Woes</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                I had a failure with some parts thatwere installed just last week, a favorite old tool died, and... How
                to be popular at parties- that's coming up. Hey it's Pete, welcome back to the workshop. Checking a few
                more things off the punch list this week- Finally got that spindle motor adapter mounted that I 3d
                printed a couple weeks ago. This is the 5th revision ofthis part as you might remember We had to design
                this because the original adapter plate had no provisions for mounting the shroudthat covers the servo
                motor. The new adapter plate has tabs that allow mounting for the shroud as well as providing some
                scoops to allow airflow. This piece was a good fit,only a little cleanup needed to remove some of the
                supports that are createdfor the 3d printing process. I'm hopeful that the next time I removethis
                pulley, it will be to install a timing belt. Next up on the list was tomake a cable to go from the DYN4
                encoder output, to the Acorn spindleencoder input. This requires three twisted pairs, plus a ground and
                an overall shield. A DMM tech recommended I just use an Ethernet cable to make this up. And this is in
                lieu of a spindle encoder for the Acorn to regulate the motor speed. If you want to be popular at
                parties, next time you're with some friends you should just bring up that this connector is not actually
                a DB9 connector. Explain to them that even though this is commonly referred to as a DB9, the "B"
                actually refers to the case size, so a DB9 connector would actuallybe the size of a DB25 connector, but
                would only have 9 pins. This, in fact, is actually a "DE9" connector and nobody calls it that. I'm sure
                if you share this, pedantic knowledge with your friends,you will be incredibly popular with them The two
                ends of this connector are wireddifferently and they aren't reversible so I need to keep track of which
                end is which. Next up was providing some way ofbringing AC power into the electrical cabinet Now on the
                side of the cabinet, there was a knock out for a rectangular connector- That actually connected
                theDynaMyte electrical cabinet, to the transformer that was mounted underneath. We no longer need this
                but I figured Icould use this hole to do something with. I went back and forth on this several times
                between trying to decide whether Iwanted to install a twist lock connector, or just put a strain relief
                in with aregular piece of wire coming out of it. I borrowed a two inch knockout- This is something I
                don't use nearly enough to warrant owning. There's just enough room to mount thisconnector beside the
                automatic lubricator It left just enough of a lip that I still had room to drill and tap for #8/32
                screws. I really wanted to use a twistlock connector but, I really almost couldn't justify the cost of
                doing that. This is one of those cases where, what went through my mind was, "okay I really want the
                twist lock, and if I don't do it like this in the beginning, I'm probably never gonna go back to do it"
                - so I spent the money and I got the twist lock connectors. Wiring the connector is fairly
                straightforward, the ground, neutral, &amp; hot screws all color-coded- with green for ground, white for
                neutral,and brass for the hot lines. Now if you're a subscriber, you may havenoticed a community post
                about my heat gun breaking I took it apart to see if I could fix it,but realized the actual problem was
                the case itself. The electronics inside are fine, but the case is so brittle and deteriorated, that it's
                no longer holding the internal components in the proper relationship toone another so it just doesn't
                work. I looked into getting a new one but on awhim I looked up the manufacturer, and discovered that
                they still sell parts for this. I ordered a brand new external shell for this, and it should be
                herelater this week. The serial number by the way on this is 288. I don't know if that means 2nd month
                of 88, or if it's literally number 288. So, on to my failure for this week- the stepper motor connectors
                that I installed last week, they are not gonna work. First off in the comments, a viewer "CNC Obsession"
                pointed out that I, I should have crimped thoserather than soldering them. and.... that's right. I mean
                I know that I should have done that. And I don't know why I didn't do that. I have the tool to do that
                so I really have no excuse. The deciding factor though was that the connectors actually startedmaking a
                sizzling noise. I decided, okay that was that- I'm just gonna ordercrimp-on connectors and we'll go from
                there. These are Deutsch connectors that I'm installing. it's a model DTM which stands for a miniature
                Deutsch connector. These are somewhat confusing to order, you have to order the pins and thehousings and
                the retainers all separately unless you'repurchasing them in an assortment. I'm really not sure why
                Ididn't do this begin with. I have the crimping tool and standing at the machine crimping on connectors
                was much easier than soldering. This was both better and easier. I will have links to the tools and
                partsI used down in the video description Of course changing the connectorsmeant I had to pull new
                wires. I taped a wire to the previous to useas a fish to pull the new wire in. I will need to revisit
                all these piecesof heat shrink tubing once my gun is repaired. Up to this point I wasn'tcompletely sure
                how it was gonna handle the incoming AC power. I ended up installing 2DIN rail mount fuse holders- one
                on each hot leg of theincoming 240 volt line. The twist lock connector instructions were onthe inside of
                the box- not really much to know. There were several different wire clamps provided depending on the
                diameter of cable you use. But the stock gray ones were correct for my cable. Then I just had to run a
                new wireover for the cable drop. I finished up the last bit ofthe axis wiring by landing the X, Y, &amp;
                Z home switches to inputs1, 2, &amp; 3 on the Acorn. And again, I got to remember tocome back here with
                this heat gun. The last major hurdleon this retrofit is ahead of me- Deciding what to do about external
                control. I need to decide howI'm going to mount the monitor and keyboard and what if any
                hardwiredswitches I want to have. Obviously, there'll be an e-stop. I'm just not sure if I want to have
                other hardwired switches, like say for instance a floodcoolant override switch. I'd be curious to hear
                your thoughts in the comments. I have panel mount USB and HDMI connectors, I'm just not completely
                surewhere I'm going to install them. Originally the idea was that the computerwould actually go in the
                electrical cabinet, and these connectorswould then go in the side of the cabinet. But now I'm not
                completelysure about that idea. Since I have to send 120 volts ACout to the monitor anyways, I'm
                wondering if I shouldn't just build a box out there that houses the computer, and then all I would
                really need to sendback to this control panel would bean Ethernet cable. and there would be no need for
                the USB and HDMI expansion connectors in this cabinet at all. That's something to think about over the
                coming week. And if you'd like to see another project I've done, click that link to theleft and I will
                catch you over there.

          <h2>Centroid Acorn CNC Controller- DM2800 Milling Machine Retrofit Project</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                that's not gonna work at all. change ofplans hey it's Pete welcome back to myworkshop so the last time
                around when I started hooking up the Centroid Acornand one of the things I mentioned was that I wasn't
                going to be using thedb25 connector unfortunately the signal that the 251Xdrives is expecting just isn't
                easy to get out of the screw terminals. The screwterminals on the Acorn are open collector outputs and
                that's convenientbecause you can hook them up to almost any sort of voltage. The downside is theG251X is
                expecting a 5 volt driven signal and there are no pull-upresistors on it so it would get really sloppy
                because I would have to hadpull-up resistors to every single terminal and it's just it's not going
                tolook nice so I decided to revert back we're going to use the db25 connector soI went ahead and I made
                up a cable. we'll be using the the step and direction forthe first three axis and then I'll be still
                using the enable signal that'scoming out of the Acorn (screw terminals) now the enable signal I think we
                have a littlebit of inversion there to do because on one end it's called "Enable" and on theother device
                it's called "Disable" and I think the way it works out of the box isgonna need to be flipped. so I went
                ahead and I made the cable and hooked that up -the step and direction on all three drives and then I ran
                enable wires over fromthe first three axes as well the X, Y, &amp; Z Hey if you haven't done so already
                Ishould appreciate if you subscribe to this channel This is just basically a matter ofrepeating the same
                steps over and over for every axis. now these I think aregoing to have to be inverted alright and the
                z-axis Also ended up replacing that fan on theheatsink. I got a fan that was a little bit larger moves a
                little bit more airso we should really have no problems there. I went ahead and started wiringthe
                outputs then. I'm bringing them down to terminal blocks at the bottom and Ijust decided to color code
                them along with the matching wires we're going through now and adding the48 volt supply. you can get
                terminal block jumpers that would jump across these and essentially tie them all together making them
                the same voltagebut I do not have jumpers that fit these particular terminal blocks and to buythem it's
                kind of expensive because they sell them in huge sets more than I'llever need so I am going to not do
                that and instead I'm going to run threeindividual wires from the terminal blocks up to the power supply
                connectionand that'll just give me additional current handling capability anyways sothere's really
                nothing wrong with doing that. but this should be more currentthan the stepper drives will ever need
                Power this up and connect it to thedrives. I'm gonna want to verify that this thing has 48 volts coming
                out of itI don't want to go and hook that all up and find out I have a huge problem afterthe fact kind
                of got held up there at thebeginning with that change of direction I had to take on the feeding the
                stepperdrives but now that we got that sorted out I think we should be pretty muchready to go. Alright
                just a quick review of where we are up to this point. Wired in the 48 volt power supply into these
                terminal blocks these blocks will thenfeed our stepper drives I'm not going to hook them up thoughtill I
                get AC power to the power supply so that we know that this is actuallyputting out clean voltage I don't
                want to blow anything up on the drives. Theinputs- all eight of them have been run down to terminal
                blocks here at thebottom. I've put a couple terminal blocks in for our 24 volt power supply so theblue
                will be the minus side the brown will be the plus 24 volts. Haven't doneanything with the outputs yet
                because I believe some of these outputs are goingto be used directly inside of the electrical cabinet
                for things likewiring the spindle brake and wiring the the coolant pump things like thatbecause actually
                right now this this relay up here is actually the relay thathandles the spindle brake 24 volt power
                coming in here.Connections to the output boards Our DB25 connector that gives our stepand direction
                signal over to the G251X drives. The enable lines for X, Y, &amp; Z goingover to the drives so the only
                thing left to do on the drives is to get powerto them and I also have to set the current with a current
                set resistor oneach one of these. Hey if you haven't done so already I sure would appreciate it if you
                hit that subscribe button over there and if you enjoy watching projectslike this giving it a thumbs up
                down there let's YouTube know you'd like tosee more content just like it. That's about it for this time

          <h2>Tailstock Turret Attachment- Restoring the Enco Lathe Turret Tailstock</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
            Hey it's Pete, welcome back to myworkshop. Switching gears here just a little bit
                this week. I'm waiting to hearback from a vendor who has a possible spindle motor replacement that's
                gonnafit our DM 2800 retrofit that we're working on. In the meantime I've got aClausing Colchester lathe
                here, 13-inch and it has a turret tail stock. Thatturret tail stock has not been operating and I've got
                a project coming up where Icould potentially use that so we're gonna tear into that today and try to doa
                clean-up on it and see if we can't get it back in operation. This turret tailstock is designed to fit
                the Clausing Colchester 13-inch lathe and myunderstanding is that that's how Enco actually got into
                business- building tailstocks to fit specific lathes now this Enco "HexTurret" tailstock haslived on the
                end of my lathe almost as long as I've owned the lathe and when Ioriginally bought this lathe I bought
                it for a specific project. I found it in alocal classified newspaper and when I went and saw it for the
                first time thistailstock actually sat on it and I negotiated a deal with the peopleselling it and I
                really couldn't afford what they wanted for the tailstock so Ididn't end up buying it. The lathe just
                came bare so I still had to buy toolingfor it, had to buy a chuck for it. I had to build a three-phase
                converter for it.so I had a lot of expenses going into it I just I needed that extra money and Icouldn't
                afford to also get this tailstock Fast forward a few years and Iactually ended up working for that
                company and this tailstock sat aroundfor a number of years and finally one of the owners said "do you
                want this thing?because we're not ever gonna do anything with it" So I took it home and it's livedon the
                end of my lathe ever since. taking off this front gib underneaththere's a very thin brass shim stock and
                just looking at it I didn't realize howthin it was. when I rubbed my cloth across that I almost crumpled
                it all upit only measures about a thousandth thick I've got some production workcoming up where this
                tailstock could actually come in handy doing a coupledifferent operations for me. so I figured it was
                time to get this thing cleaned up and working. The main problem that this tailstock has is the tool
                holders are all stuck. it's very difficult to change tools because the locking posts are mangled up a
                bit and they won't move freely. Here in the lower bed of theturret we have some evidence that we were
                visited by mice in the past. it's kind of a weird place to live this uses three quarter-inch
                straightshank tooling and over the years I've collected quite a bit of it. when I see it come up on eBay
                I snatch it up if it's a decent price thinking that eithersomeday I'll be using it or if I ever go to
                sell the thing it'll be more valuablethat way possibly that's probably wishful thinking this is actually
                comingapart pretty well anytime I see tapered pins I always get nervous but so far allthese are coming
                out really well. So I'm going to be stripping this down as far as I can we're gonna dunk all the parts
                in the Purple Power get them degreasedand then the parts that have rust on them we'll be throwing those
                into theEvapo Rust. if you'd like to help this channel, the easiest way to do it - if youhaven't done so
                already - is to click that subscribe button. it doesn't cost you athing and it really helps the channel
                out. I always find it interesting takingapart older equipment like this. some of the bolts you remove
                have a very strong odor of cutting oil I'm using my color-coded hex key set again. I can't overemphasize
                how much I love these things. It's just so nice to know that,you know, once I know this bolt takes the
                blue hex key I just have to reach for itI don't have to try fumbling through a pile of them to find the
                one I want. So are there just any distinguishingmarks tell me which side is which here I think this is
                pinned. yep There, so this- that hits that. So there's that plate. so there's our Springs that it floats
                on. There it is. fight me all the way I let these parts soak overnight in thepurple power I'm going to
                scrub them all down and get them out of here I'm gonna follow up with the Evapo Rust on some of these
                parts and then a few of those areactually going to get the Oxpho Blue treatment as well so I took this
                bin of parts inside and Irinsed the Purple Power off of them. And now we're just gonna clean them
                upbefore they flash rust Alright. Lets see what else we got in here just cleaning everything up with
                alcoholto try to displace any water that might still be on these I'm not quite sure how to finish that.
                Ithink I'd almost like to make this bright. Paint this and paint the castingleave the machine surface.
                there's a few parts on this tailstock that I'm not quite sure how I want to finish so be sure to stick
                around to the end of the video. I'm going to be asking for some input on exactly what might be the
                bestway to finish a few of these metal parts somebody was in here banging away onthis thing. the biggest
                problem with this entire tool post is is the tool holdersthemselves. All of them are jammed in and you
                can't get them out makes it verydifficult for changing tools There we go Actually, this would be better
                if I just had the right sized wrench... ...But I don't own the right size wrench. see if screwing this
                all the way in.. will allow me to turn it I just needed to break loose alright it might be time to take
                this out of this. There we go. These all have the same problem.The lip that... The clamping area has
                been damaged and and mushroomed out alittle bit just enough to prevent it from coming out There we go.
                you can see all the shiny parts where wewere rubbing getting out. And the damage done to that Alright
                I'd like to hear yourthoughts down in the comments on what kind of finish I should put on thisturret
                here. it's one of the few parts that's actually going to be bare metalwhen it's finished. everything
                else is either painted or Blued Alright, we're gonnaWe're gonna dump this in the Evap Rust But that's
                not gonna be until Tomorrow. it turns out that I spoketoo soon when I mentioned how easily all the taper
                pins were coming out. I had aheck of a time trying to get the taper pin out of this bevel gear it
                almostappeared like at some point in the past somebody had broken off a punch. There was something very
                hard inside. I ended up having to drill it out. it took so long to do that my camera gave up recording
                so I don't actually have anyfootage of getting it finally out of there I went out and got a quart
                ofsherwin-williams haze gray I'm gonna throw a quick coat of it here under the sliding part of the
                turret just to see if I like the color if I don't like itnobody will see it down here Surprises me, here
                in the video it actually lookswhite but in reality it is gray I'm hopeful that we can wrap this up inthe
                next video. At this point most of the cleanup is done we've got some paintingto do then reassembly and
                I've got an idea of how I want to try to reproducethe original Enco badge that was on the top. And as
                always please like, share,comment down below I really want to hear your thoughts on finishing the
                metalwork on that turret and I'll catch you next week. Hit that subscribe button

          <h2>Centroid Acorn CNC 12 install & bench test - Dyna Myte 2800 retrofit</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
            Hey it's Pete welcome back to myworkshop. This week I'm gonna get a computer set up,
                I'm gonna get Centroid CNC12 installed on it, and we're gonna get it talking to Acorn- and
                hopefullywe're gonna get to see a stepper motor move alright we're gonna go through theprocess of
                setting up this computer to install the Acorn CNC software now I'vegot the PDF in front of me here with
                all the configuration instructions I'vepreviously gone through and I've checked that this machine does
                in fact meet theminimum requirements of being a CNC computer and I already know- actually Ijust finished
                running the Windows updates so I don't need to do that and Ialso know that the account that I'm
                currently using has administrator rights so I don't need to do anything there. so the first thing we
                need to do is go downto the "System and Security" and we're going to be turning off some stuff herethat
                might interfere with the Acorn communication. so go into "System andSecurity", "Security and
                Maintenance" and then scrolling down here we're going togo into the "Change Security and Maintenance
                Settings" and we're going tobe clearing out all these check boxes to prevent some pop-up messages and
                thingsthat might occur in normal operation So I'm going to get rid of all thatscrolling down here we're
                going to go and change account control we're goingto turn this all the way down to "Never Notify" and
                we're gonna have to say yesto that because that is an administrative thing and then we'regoing to go
                back to Windows Defender firewall and we aregoing to turn the Windows Defender firewall off so that's
                thereand right there and say okay that gets us there and then finally we're going to go back hereand
                we're going to go into "Power Options" Power Options We're already in high-performance mode.We're gonna
                go in here turn the display off / computer sleep never we want tochange some advanced settings this
                hard-diskwe want to set this to zero so that it never shuts off and that'll say neverwhen we click away.
                we're also going to want to check the USB settings make sureSelective Suspend is disabled and what else
                do we have in here that we need todo? sleep- we already have that turned off sleep after never- we'll
                just turn thisoff. Hybernate after never. Allow wake timers and anything else in here? No I'm thinking -
                we've got the processor already set, maximum. "Displayturn off after" it should be never okay so we're
                good hereget out of there and then finally we're gonna go backhere and we want to go to the "Clock and
                Region" setting and "Set Time and Date"head over here to "Internet Time" and we want to change these
                settings, we want toturn that Off so that it does not go out on the internet trying to update itstime
                settings. so where are we at here anything else? Uninstall programs-I actually know that this is already
                a minimal build system so we don't reallyneed to do anything there so I think that that is- we'll go
                ahead and have alook at this here. most of the stuff in here is required for this machine and alot of it
                doesn't do we got some Mitsubishi stuff in here on some YaskawaElectric stuff but yeah I think mostly
                we're good shape here Alright I've got the Acorn boardplugged in powered up and I have the ethernet
                cable connected over to mycomputer. we're going to go ahead and unzip this to the desktop- okay
                that'sgood - and then we're gonna go in here and see what we've got- just a single setupfile. This is
                just a popup message from Windows Defender complaining that it'snot available And we'll agree and we'll
                say next- and we're going tochoose CNC12 mill let this install and "Next" networkadapter setup say yes
                successfully set Ethernet adapter. Finish- and let's try running it And it communicated with the
                Acorn,it's rebooting and so there we go we successfully setup this computer to talk to the Acorn So I've
                gone ahead and I've made theconnection for the stepper motor to the x-axis drive on our control board
                nowthis is actually the z-axis motor but they're all the sameand when hooking these up you have the
                option of either wiring them in seriesmode or parallel mode. For our application here we're gonna have
                to runthem in series because the g251X Gecko Drive can't quite put out enough powerto run these in
                parallel mode. next thing I need to do is get into the centroidCNC software and make a few configuration
                changes specifically forthe enable signal to get these drives running. Alright, I'm going to fire upthe
                Centroid CNC12 mill software and I'm gonna make some changes to theconfiguration. I've got my Acorn
                board plugged in and it's hooked to thenetwork so we should be able to talk to it here- and we're good-
                and then I needto go to this utility setting here. Go to the Acorn wizard- and what I need to dois on
                these particular drives the enable signal is actually a disabled signal soI have to invert the function
                in the setup system here. So what I need to dois under Axis and Advanced I need to go to the axis signal
                inversion and Ihave to invert the enable signal for all the axes and then just write thesesettings to
                CNC control say yes settings are saved and I can get out ofhere and now on the screen I should be ableto
                choose a fast or slow jog and if we hit our x-axiswe should be able to make this motor run Alright I'm
                gonna pull you in tight fora close-up here. alright so I'm gonna select our speed here. we're set up
                forslow jog and I should be able to jog this axis and fast speed excellent. Alright one quick thing
                worthmentioning here, when I installed the software following along in theinstructions you're told to
                connect the Acorn board to the computer and power itup before you begin the setup and if you don't do
                that then the setup softwarecannot go in and set up your network adapter properly. You can go in and
                checkthat. I just usually like to right-click Network go to Properties and then this,is the this
                computer actually has two network cards this is the one that'scurrently connected to the Acorn board so
                if you click on that go down toproperties and then what you want to do is scroll down here until you see
                theInternet Protocol version 4 tcp/ip v4 you don't want the v6 you want the v4.highlight that and then
                go to properties and you'll see here where the setupsoftware has actually given this a static IP address
                of 10.168.41.1 andthat's what you need to have in there for the computer to be able tosuccessfully talk
                to the Acorn so if that's not in there you can setthis manually just by changing from automatic to
                dedicated and then go aheadand enter these values well that went pretty well I got everything done that
                Iwant it to and it was great to see that stepper motor move. Now I'm going to beable to take everything
                and integrate them into the cabinets, get everythingwired up for real. If you like this kind of content

          <h2>Centroid Acorn CNC Retrofit of the DynaMyte 2800 Milling Machine</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                So I've been going through my checklistand I came to realize that in reality our DynaMyte 2800 -
                CentroidAcorn retrofit here is it's almost done. We have a few things wegot to get off the checklist and
                uh we could get this machine up inoperation. Hey it's Pete welcome back to theworkshop. So one of the
                first things I need to do is get the monitor mounted. I've got this articulating wall mount monitor arm,
                and we're going to be putting that on the side of the cabinet to hold a monitorfor our touch screen
                interface So next on the list is to install these extension adapters here. I have them both for USB as
                well as HDMI. I'm going to be removing those aircraftconnectors that I had installed previously. Those
                were mostly just put thereas space fillers- to fill up the holes, and i didn't have aspecific purpose
                for them, I figured they may come in handy in the future. I'm going to open those holes up and use them
                to mount these extension cables. This will give me two high-speed USBconnections and a standard USB as
                well as an HDMIconnection on the outside of the cabinet I'm not exactly sure if this monitor armis going
                to be strong enough for this application, but it was something I had on the shelfthat was left over from
                another project so I'm going to put it to use here and if it does turn out that we need to change it,
                well, we'll just change it in the future. The monitor is mounted with a standard 100 millimeter VESA
                mount and i got this keyboard tray, it is designed to slip betweenthe monitor and the arm so that it
                gets trapped inbetween there- hangs down below the monitor and givesyou a place to mount your keyboard
                and mouse. I got a little bit of cable management to do with all these USB cables since i can't really
                cut them any shorter. We just need to wind them up andtry to make them look presentable. I also need to
                install a strain relief- this is going to be for thepower going to the monitor If you notice all the
                blue tape,I try to make a habit of covering open electronics-whenever possible if I'm drilling holes
                around it. So with the computer mounted in the backof the electrical cabinet, I really have no way of
                reaching inthere to press the start button when i want to use the machine. I don't have to pull it away
                from the wall every time I want to use it and getin there. what I'm going to do is go with thisremote
                mounted start button. this is actually a purpose-built device, specifically made to extend the start
                button functionality of a computer, to some remote location. This actually takes the place of both the
                start button and the power light. There's a ring light around the button. And connectors to go onto the
                computer motherboard. You just disconnect the existing connectors that go out to the existingswitch and
                light, plug these in its place, and find some convenient place hereon the cabinet to mount this, and
                we'll be good to go. Trying to decide where to put this holereminds me of something that I tend to
                overthinkthings from time to time. and wondering about the correct holeplacement for this switch. And,
                that's really kind ofsilly actually because it doesn't really matter where it goes,and- you know, should
                it go up here? should it go at the bottom? There's always going to besomebody with a different opinion,
                even myself,tomorrow I may think differently about it. and then regret the placewhere i put the hole.
                and overall that'sprobably just kind of silly. We just need to get the thing doneand if in the future I
                don't like the hole, well we'll plug it with somethingand put the hole somewhere else. Now i just need
                to find a suitablelocation to bring the remote start wire into the computer. I found a small knockout on
                the back panel which looks like it's goingto be perfect for the job. Now it's just a matter of snaking
                thecable inside the case and making our connections to the motherboard I'll leave links down in the
                videodescription to all the parts and tools I used this week So I got the monitor mounted up. We got it
                powered up. The computer's powered up. Everything is working. The Centroid software fires up. I can
                control the different axes of the machine. The only thing we're havinga problem with now is that the
                touch screen itself is not working- this is supposed to bea 10 point touch screen. When i plug the
                USBconnector for the touch screen into the computer it is recognized. I hear the sound, I see it in
                device manager, but it's actually not functioning asa touch screen. I went into the touch
                screencalibration utility that's built into windows, and itjust doesn't see that there's any sort of
                touch screen responding when youtouch this thing. So this came from Amazon, we're going toget it swapped
                around for another one, and hopefully that'lltake care of our problem. So I've hit a little roadblock
                I've mounted this monitor and it doesn't work either. I don't exactly know what to think of that, I
                don't know. It shows up as a USB device,it's recognized as a touch screen. But when i go to calibrate
                it, or doanything with it, it just has no response whatsoever. I have noticed on the amazon website, in
                the reviews, several people have made the comment that it doesn't work with Windows 10, but an equal
                number of people havealso said it works great with windows 10. I originally suspected that maybe there
                was a problem with the first monitor,something with the connection between the touchscreen surface and
                theUSB interface electronics- maybe there was something wrong there. Which was why it was being
                recognized as USB, but there was actually no functionality. I plugged it into my windows 7laptop though
                and it worked great there , so the monitor is fine, it just doesn't seem to want to work with my version
                of windows 10. I've tried the windows update, tried the drivers, tried everything i could think of
                and,nothing seems to make it work. So we're going to try another monitor this time going for a different
                manufacturer,different make, different model. a complete different ball of wax. AndI'm not going to make
                the mistake this time of going through all the work to mount it until i know that it actually works.
                Well, this is my computer reinstalling Windows 10. That new monitor? that didn't work either. Turns out
                behind the scenes, even thoughit's a different manufacturer, -the new monitor is actually madeby Asus-
                the touchscreen hardware itself was thesame. So it was recognized in the computer as being thesame type
                of touchscreen So that fixed nothing at all. Then I went along to do some additional troubleshooting,
                trying to figure out what was the problem with the driver. I tried to do a driver verify, ended up in a
                blue screen of death, and then rather than going through the process of resetting that andgetting out of
                that I just decided, you know, the only thinginstalled on here is CNC12. Let's just wipe it out and
                start over. So that's where we're at And so as you can see now, with thereload of windows, I do have a
                functioning touch screen now So all that's working just as it should. Another item I needed to address
                was to finish the E-stop circuit.I got this box with an E-stop in it and it's currently just on a length
                of cable.I don't exactly know where it's going to be mounted.Currently the machine is sitting facing the
                wall as I'm working on theelectrical cabinet. so once i get that turned around, thenwe'll find some
                convenient place to mount this.It is currently hooked up though, if you can see it it says the emergency
                stopdetected. if we release that,that clears so we've got a, we got a working E-stop right now. I'd like
                to take a few moments and discuss how I ended up selecting this touch screen. And, uh, primarily it was
                the price- for a 21.5 inch touchscreen monitor,this was fairly inexpensive. there is a trade-off with
                that,it is a capacitive based touchscreen which means i have to use my bare handsor a specially made
                stylist to touch it.I can't wear gloves. That's not too big of an issue for me,I rarely wear gloves when
                I'm operating the the CNC machine. On the positive side, it has a glossy screen and not the matte
                finish-which i actually prefer. I know some people don't like thereflected image of the room you're in
                that can come with a glossy screen. I've never really had a problem with that. but the other thing
                iswith the glossy screen, since I'll be touching this with my fingers- which will probably be oily from
                time to time- if the screen was a matte image, youwould end up with shiny spots on it from touching that
                matte finish. You won't have that with the glossy screen you can wipe this off andpretty much be good as
                new. the other nice thing about this monitor thoughis it's an IPS architecture which just has to do with
                the way theindividual graphical LCD elements are that make up the pixels.and what an IPS gives you is
                the ability to look at the imagefairly off- fairly far off to the side It has an extreme viewing
                angle.and still being able to see the image clearly. You can't do that withother architectures of LCD
                construction. Now there is a downside to IPS.people, especially those doing gaming where they have
                really fast- theywant to see their screen update super fast,and we're talking, you know, in the
                millisecond range. This is not somethingthat's going to affect a CNC machine at all. As far as the
                screen update we're, you know, looking at some DROs and maybea graphical representation of our cut
                cycle. So i think it's going to be fine. Having that off axis viewing angle is going to be really nice
                no matter where I am in theOff... In the shop here. I'll be able to see,you know, what's going on on the
                screen. And because it's a fairly large screen,I'll be able to see it from quite a ways away. The final
                thing left to do is to tune the servo drive for the spindle motor.I've been working on this a little bit
                on and off over the last few weeks, I hadsome limited success, but I did run into a fewissues. I've been
                going back and forth throughemail with DMM-Tech talking about things like inertiamismatch and exactly
                what i should expect out ofthe 750 watt motor, what its capabilities are. Looks likewe're going to take
                the plunge and upgrade to the 1000 watt versionof that motor I know there's some interest out therein
                that particular motor so we're gonna be doing that.and I've got a tracking number- it should be here
                this coming weekso that's what we'll be hitting next. If you just stumbled across this channeland you'd
                like to catch up with this project from the beginning,I got a whole playlist just dedicated to the
                retrofit of our DynaMyte 2800 to the Centroid Acorn control system. Just click that link to the rightand
                I will see you over there.

          <h2>CNC Mill Retrofit- Spindle Motor Adapter</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                Hey it's Pete, welcome back to theworkshop. So I got the spindle motor mounted but not without a problem
                or twoand I may have had to do a few sketchy things to make it work. I'm gonna sharethat with you this
                week. So there were two parts to this project, the firstbeing modifying the bushing for the step-pulley
                The original motor had ahalf-inch shaft and the new motor has a fourteen millimeter shaft. So we need
                toincrease the bore size. Before doing that I dunked a couple parts in the Evapo-Rust and that worked as
                well as it always does. I'm always impressed by that. I generally put the parts in at the end of the
                day- I come out the next morning,take them out, they all look practically good as new. So the first part
                of this project was tobore out the bushing and in doing so I realized I had a couple problems. The first
                of which was a problem I've had for some time and that is the tailstockon my lathe that does not want to
                bolt down securely to the bed. It won't lockin place. so when trying to drill something slightly hard,
                like this bushing, all I succeeded in doing was cranking the crank and having the tailstock moved
                backwards- rather than actually drilling. So I decided it wastime to fix this problem. Popped off the
                tailstock and startedtaking it apart and I should have realized something right from the very beginning
                because when I got to this set screw, the set screw was just barelyscrewed in. When I inserted the Allen
                wrench, the screw was basically up at thetop of the threads. there it goes. Because this has to go on
                here first. And then this has to go in So as I started putting it back together, Irealized the set screw
                was going in much further and I thought that I had fixedit, but that was not to be the case. I'm not
                really clear how this got like this I don't recall having ever taken this tailstock apart in the entire
                timethat I've owned this lathe However this problem has only been around forprobably the last three or
                four years Now you see that it isn't right, because that should not be able to come out like that.
                That's working properly so the setscrew just wasn't in quite far enough it was, it was clamping
                againstone of the high spots rather than actually going down in the groove that it was supposed to. so I
                just needed to take it apart one more time and fiddlethat around a little bit and then I finally got it
                working just like it wassupposed to. I think that might be it Yeah cuzthere's a dead stop in there. It
                doesn't come out, okay. so all of this downtime wasanother opportunity to fix one more thing that had
                been annoying me forquite a while Oh, Yeah.... I think we've got it the second thing Irealized was that
                the bushing was probably just a little bit harder than Iwas expecting so I decided to hit it with a
                torch to see if I could temper ita little bit bring the hardness down to something that was more easily
                drilled so I was able to get my drill through itand that did a pretty decent job and then my next step
                was to take a 14mm reamer, and what I was hoping to do was to be able to ream a slightly oversized hole
                because that's what usually happens when I don't want anoversized hole I figured well this will be the
                time to do it.Unfortunately this reamer did exactly 14mm and I needed, I needed thatto be opened up just
                a little bit to be able to slide smoothly onto the motorshaft. So here's where things got sketchy I
                discovered that I've seemed to havelost or misplaced all of my small boring bars So I have no way to
                enlarge thishole and I have ordered a new set but with the current state of things, they'renot going to
                be here for a few days yet and I wanted to move on this project. I started thinking about it and I
                realized I have a dremel tool with a flex shaft so I decided to give that a try This flex shaft is a
                Dremel model 225 T1 that's actually hard to find. Dremel changed the current version of thisproduct, it
                now has a more ergonomic hand-piece- but that would make what I'mgoing to attempt here impossible. There
                do seem to be a few aftermarket versionswith a relatively straight hand-piece and I will leave a link
                down in the videodescription So I've owned this Dremel tool for about25 years and over that time I've
                put it to use on many projects so the bearingsin this are far from new. I did have some concerns that I
                could possibly bedestroying the entire bushing with this operation. but moving forward down theroad.
                eventually I'm going to be switching out these step pulleys to atiming belt so we'll need a new bushing
                at that point anyways I really don'thave that much to lose here So I took it slowly with the Dremel
                seton the highest speed possible. and I'm not going to know what kind of run out Ihave until I get this
                thing mounted on the machine So the next part of the process was todesign the adapter plate to mount the
                motor to the top of the milling machine. and my idea there was to use the original plate as a reference
                and what I was gonna do was use my 3d printer to design and print a part- thinking therethat I could go
                through all the design work before committing it to metal and it's a good thing I did because it took me
                four tries to get it right the first plate that I designed and printed up had a few issues the first
                being that my 3dprinter was not calibrated properly so some of my dimensions weren't coming outright. In
                addition to that I misjudged the bolt hole pattern for the levers sothat they were not on the right
                diameter so with my next attempt things got muchcloser to the ideal. everything was mounting up properly
                and looking good I just had to focus then on getting the height proper for the motor to line upwith the
                pulleys I did a whole lot of drawing and sketching in CAD and both on paper. And somehow I still managed
                to mess it up and I went way overboard I had a huge offset which set the motor up way too high I still
                don't know what Iwas thinking but that one was clearly wrong. So the fourth time was the charm,
                Idesigned it and printed it and it came out just like I needed it to. Everythinglined up really well My
                hope here is that I'll actually be able to use this part and run the machine with it in place, and
                hopefully use the machine toactually create the metal version of this part. These are sacrificial
                supportsI'm removing from the countersink holes these just help the 3d printer bridgeover what would
                otherwise be an unsupported area when it's printing I finished with a bit of clean up, this stuff
                de-burrs really nicely this part was 3d printedin ABS plastic with a fairly high fill rate, and I prefer
                the finishing optionsthat ABS gives me and since my printer can do it, I see noreason to print in any
                other sort of plastic like PLA or PETG. Several years ago a local hardware store went out of business,
                and I attended the auction where I picked up a number of storage cabinets, as well as a lot of hardware
                and some of these hardware bins I still use on a daily basis it's really convenient to have these in my
                shop I just have to remember to occasionallyrestock them so I continue to have them on hand I've been
                able to stay at homeand spend most of my time here tinkering in the workshop, but I have two
                daughterswho have jobs where they're considered essential. one is a nurse and the otherworks for the US
                Post Office in between printing these motor adapters, I've keptmy 3d printer busy making surgical masks
                ear savers for my daughters and theirco-workers so the final step is to get this mountedonto the milling
                machine I want to get a dial indicator on there and see whatkind of run out we have on this pulley so
                it's looking to me like we have justunder a thousandth of run out on the pulley. We have more than one
                high spotper revolution which is kind of indicating to me that it's in the pulley itself one thing I
                find a bit interesting is the spindle pulley, which I haven't touched at all, is measuring 3 thou of
                run-out. Now 6 years ago I did fire this thing upand I ran the spindle up to 10k without any vibration
                at all, so I'm curious tosee how this is gonna work. And I'm almost to the point where I can fire it up,
                but I've got a bit more work to do on the electrical panel before that can happen I got a few more
                components to hook up, but that's gonna have to waittill next time. for now, if you want to see where we
                last left off with the electrical panel click that link to the left and I will see you over there.

          <h2>UV Inkjet Prints On Metal: Machine Tag Reproduction</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                Hey it's Pete, welcome back to myworkshop. This week I'm continuing on with the restoration work on the
                turrettail stock for my Clausing Colchester lathe. What I want to try tackling thisweek is to see if I
                can reproduce the machine tag that sits on the back ofthat turret, it's a small little metal tag it says
                Enco Manufacturing, and ithas the original serial number of the unit. It's really messed up and I
                don'tthink I can restore it so we're just gonna try to make a new one. I got an idea how I can do that
                here in the shop or at least make a reasonable facsimileand I have one specialized piece of equipment
                that I think is gonna makethat happen so let's get right into it So I started the process off by
                creatingthe artwork for the tag. I imported a picture of the machine tag into Photoshop and then began
                drawing the various elements of the tag right there I'm not going to go into a deep explanation of how
                Photoshop works but the important takeaway here that I found is to start with an image as large
                aspossible. This image actually measures over 26 inches across and what that allows me to do, is I do my
                tracing. The final thing I do is I resize itdown an Inch &amp; 15/16" and then all of my tracing errors
                become so small that they just don't matter So after resizing, we turn off all the backgroundlayers and
                we're left with just the artwork for the tag which I then go andexport as a PNG file which is something
                my printer can accept I sourced a pieceof aluminum from Lowe's it's 20 thou thick It's a pretty good
                match for the original and Ijust laid the tag on there and I scribed around it. I don't have a shear in
                myshop and I thought about maybe using tin snips but I didn't think I'd get a veryclean cut out of that
                and we'd have curling and things. so I thought maybe Icould get away using my paper cutter and as it
                turned out that actually workedpretty well. The pieces came out nice and flat with no serrated edges. I
                don'tthink I'd want to subject this poor little paper cutter to this type ofabuse continuously, but for
                one or two pieces this worked out great so I'm going to be printing directly onto this label I'm hitting
                it with a bit of steelwool to give it a bit more "tooth" for the ink to stick to. And thenapplying some
                double-sided tape. We're gonna be taping it directly down to the flatbed printer. Now previously I've
                gone through and I've already printed the image on the bed, this gives me an alignment jig to know where
                to put thetag down so we just tape that in place and then I'm going to hit it with achemical called an
                adhesion promoter it's provided by the ink manufacturer,I think it's literally just a de-greaser to help
                the ink stick better Then we just open up the artwork in our printing software. So this is our printer,
                it is a heavily modified Epson inkjet printer and itbegan its life as an Epson L800 which is part of a
                series of printers Epsonrefers to as their EcoTank line. It doesn't actually have individual
                inkcartridges, but rather it has a refillable reservoir on the side. Thismakes it highly attractive as a
                printer to hack. So what has been done here isall of the existing ink lines which are normally clear,
                are replaced with blackand instead of using the reservoir, individual bottles of a UV curable inkare
                used. In addition to that, a UV curing light is mounted side car to the printerhead and it also has
                water cooling lines run to it. So this causes the ink to cureas the head is going back and forth
                printing. Another element of this printeris it also can print with white ink which is something you
                don't normallyhave in an inkjet printer. Normally the printer would rely on the paper you'reprinting on
                to provide the white color. And finally the paper feed mechanism hasbeen removed and replaced with a
                flatbed. This particular printer was never soldin the US, it was intended for the European marketso it's
                an a4 paper size. Now my UV curing light is starting to wear out just a little bit. This printer is
                about four years old so I always go ahead andI hit it with some extra UV just to ensure that it cures.
                This is a 2 pass printer, it prints first the white ink and then you pull back the bed and startit again
                and it lays the color ink down on top of it. You see there at the top ofthe screen the silver tube
                that's a ventilation line that takes the fumesoutside. this ink has a very strong smell to it.this is
                not a printer that you would want to have in your house. Also there'snormally a cover that goes over the
                whole top there that you don't see theentire mechanism like this but this printer unfortunately does
                require a lotof maintenance and it's just easier to work on it without that lid in place normally this
                printer is used in my shop to print the legends and logos and things on the electronic enclosures we
                manufacture here. So it's laying down thered ink on top of the white I think we got a pretty good match
                for the color I'm liking the way it's turning out. I decided to go ahead and print the serialnumber and
                the Colchester name directly on the label rather than trying to stampthem or engrave them. I don't have
                stamps the right size I could engrave it and Imay come back at a later date and revisit this and
                actually make a versionthat doesn't have those on there and I'll put them on the CNC machine andactually
                engrave them but this is more or less a proof-of-concept for me to seeif this is going to work out and
                so far the results look pretty promising so if you search online for DTS printer which stands for
                "Direct To Substrate" you willfind some instructions how to build something like this or you can do what
                Idid and go directly to eBay and buy one already done. Brand new they cost abouttwo thousand dollars but
                you can find used ones for cheaper- just be forewarnedif you go the used route, you'll probably have to
                swap out the printhead I just hit it with some more UV light to finish the curing process and that's
                that so I'm really happy with how these cameout I made two of them and I think they'll pass as a
                reasonable facsimileof the original One question I did have was exactly how sturdy this ink is so I
                decided to hit it with some ScotchBrite just to see if the ink would come offand all it really did was
                took the sheen off of the ink and I kind of almostliked that look a little bit I could see some
                applications where that couldbe your final finish. but since the ScotchBrite didn't hit it,I took some
                sandpaper to it really to give it a test and the the sandpaperdoes take it off but I would expect the
                sandpaper to take it off a regular labelso overall I have to say I'm really pleased with how this turned
                out I think I'm gonna have to chalk that up in the Win column. and I think it's a processthat I can
                continue to improve upon it also gives me ideas for other processes.I'm wondering if I can actually use
                the UV ink as a resist for etching. so inother words take my original artwork and invert it and print
                that as a resist,etch the tag and then strip the UV ink off to see if we could actually make atruly
                etched plate. Might be an interesting experiment So as always please- Like, Share, Subscribe, Comment
                down below if you have any additionalthoughts and I will catch you next week.

          <h2>Stepper Motor Power Supply & Spindle Motor- Milling Machine Retrofit</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                welcome back to myworkshop- gonna dig in and hopefully make a bit more progress on the electricalpanel
                for the DM 2800 retrofit so I need to set up some current set resistors forthe gecko drives the way they
                operate they require a resistor to be placedacross two of the terminals this will set the current that
                you desire. Now the g251 I believe it can go up to three and a half amps and if you put noresistor in
                you'll get your three and a half amps total but one of the featuresthat the that drive has is a roll
                back capability where it will roll back to anidle current when the drive is not movingif you don't
                install the resistor you don't get that functionality. So I founda couple of 2.2 K ohm resistors in my
                old parts drawers and that should giveme a current to the motor of about 2.2 amps. Alright first thing I
                want to dotoday is to get a cheater cord hooked up to this 48 volt power supply to verifythat I actually
                have 48 volts coming out of it. I want to do that before I hook upany of the drives This will just be a
                temporary connection and I can also adjustthis pot here if I need to to get the voltage I'm looking for
                And then I'll also be adding the currentset resistors okay let's plug that in and see what happens Ok,
                nothing blew up that's a good sign let me get ameter and check the voltage coming out of it. alright
                let's see what we got and there 50 point 6so we'll see if we can lower that just a little bit. There
                we're spot-on 48 volts. alright I'm gonna let this burn a little while just to make sure I don't have
                any surprises so I let the power supply run for about15 minutes and I could smell a slight odor off of
                it but that's probably justbecause it hasn't been run in a number of years and it's just you know
                somesurface oils and things burning off the surface of some of the components thatget a little warm but
                it held its voltage steady for those 15 or 20minutes so I'm reasonably secure in continuing on with
                wiring up the stepperdrives So I'm going to go ahead and wire upthese stepper drives I'm also gonna go
                and install those current set resistorsthat I previously heat shrinked so the first terminal on these is
                ground and that's just a thread that's not athat's not a wire there so there's our ground wire in the
                Plus and then we have this currentset. all right that's going to set thecurrent to 2.2 amps which should
                be in the ballpark forthese stepper motors So that's all the connections we need to make all right Iwill
                go ahead and get the rest of these done and then we'll go on to the nextthing Alright I've got the 48
                volt power supply wired over to the stepperdrives and I've got the current set resistor at least on the
                X and y-axisfor now and then of course we have our A and B phases going out to the steppermotor and then
                the step direction and enable signals coming in so that'spretty much it with the exception of course
                that final current set resistordown here on the z axis so I had a comment from Marti CNC garage on
                aprevious video warning me that I needed to make sure I used isolation betweenthe Acorn and the spindle
                drive and I appreciate that info I've got somethingon order and we'll be installing that but one thing
                it did was it made mestart to think that I really don't know much about this spindle drive I knowexactly
                how it was hooked up I have lots of notes of how it was previously wiredI've got pictures I've got video
                so I know exactly how to hook it back up theproblem is I really don't know much about the functionality
                of the drivethere's some unused terminals on the screw terminal block and you know Idon't know if
                there's some functionality there that I could take advantage ofthat wasn't used in the previous life for
                instance I don't know if this driveis capable of going in reverse Never went in Reverse on the DM 2800
                but that'snot to say it's not possible and if I'd ever like to do rigid tapping with thisof course I'll
                need it to be able to go reverse so there's some things about thedrive I'd like to know the proper
                tuning procedure things like that so if you dohappen to have some information on this drive I would
                really appreciate itbecause as it stands right now according to the internet this drive doesn't
                existunfortunately I think its lifespan came and went before the advent of theinternet and documentation
                on it just isn't online I can't find a thing I'vetalked to ElectroCraft they sent me off to Rockwell
                Automation I've talked toReliance I've talked to some people who claim that they actually fix
                thisparticular drive and asked them if they could send me anydocumentation they sent me documentation
                for a completely different drive so I'mkind of at a standstill. However through all of that I did learn
                a lot about the rest of the electronics on this panel how how they function and what theirpurposes are
                actually discovered something a little bit surprising aboutthe way the spindle brake works so I'm going
                to pull you in tighter and giveyou an overview of what the electrical panel does. Alright we're gonna
                startdown here in the lower left corner of the electrical panel now coming in fromthe outside world your
                incoming voltage comes through a transformer it comes outof the transformer tapped at 115 volts and then
                goes through the E-stop that'son the front panel. From the Estop it goes through a fuse and then it
                makesits way into this panel where it goes into the magnetic contactor now there'sa start start or a
                power on/off switch on the main control panel that pullsthis contactor in so that's your that's your
                main on off for the whole cabinetafter leaving the contactor it ends up over at this line filter and
                then comingout a line filter goes through a 5 amp circuit breaker then straight into thisbridge
                rectifier and then which is filtered by this capacitor now this isthe bus voltage for the spindle drive
                it comes out of there at around 160 voltsDC. also then tapping off of the voltage we end up over at the
                solid state relay its purpose is to control the coolant pump Now the way this is controlled boththe
                coolant pump and the spindle can be under control of the original Dyna Mytecontroller but it's kind of a
                dumb control it's either on or off so youhave a switch on the front panel. which turns it to local or
                program and thenyou have an on/off switch for both the spindle and for the coolant pump nowwith the way
                this works when you have it in local mode you can individually turnon and off the coolant pump or the
                spindle. but when it's in program mode thoseswitches basically determine whether that functionality is
                used or not sothere's only one on/off signal that's coming from the original Dyna Mytecontroller so when
                a run starts presumably it would turn this output onand then if you had your spindle turned on with the
                switch it would turn that onif you had your coolant turned on it would turn that on so there was
                noindividual on/off control for the coolant or the spindle likewisedoesn't appear there was any speed
                control either the speed control had tobe set on the front panel and then whatever it was set at is what
                thatprogram would run at so that's it for the lower right cornerof course this is the Acorn power supply
                we added in here I'm going tomove you up to the upper left corner and show you what's going on up there
                okay moving to the upper left corner of the machine we have this panel withthree separate items on it
                the topmost item is a digital to analog converterthat works in conjunction with the spindle drive we'll
                come back to that.the next board down is where the limit switches tie into the machine I'massuming with
                the electronics on the panel this is just some sort of debouncecircuitry or something like that and I
                don't think we're going to actually needit and then this unit here controls the spindle brake.now the
                way this works this unit has power all the time if the E-stop is ispulled out and the machine is
                energized this is powered up and what happensis transformer down here creates 24 volts DC I believe
                there's actually somein-line diodes down here that are hidden that you can't really see but I'massuming
                they're in there they're heat shrinked and it looks like some sort ofcomponent. Goes through this relay
                and what happens is this relay is directlyacross this capacitor so as long as there's power on the
                machine thiscapacitor is our this relay is pulled in charges up this capacitor and it justsits there and
                if you hit the E-stop what happens is this dumps this relayout and it applies the 24 volts in this
                capacitor across the brake on the top ofthe spindle motor and that gives it just enough power to brake
                the spindle andthen it's done so this this thing is on all the time just charged up waiting todump its
                energy into that spindle brake Now the digital-to-analog converter this iswhere I have some questions
                because this is where the potentiometer that's on thefront panel ties into it also receives the signal
                from the original controlsystem I believe which is just an on-off signal to to turn the drive on or
                offand there's an interface to the encoder that sits on top of the motor sobasically through that
                feedback it sends out a signal over to the spindle drivethe question I have is I don't know what that
                signal is whether it's a zero toten volt signal or whether it's a series of pulses or exactly what that
                drive istaking. If that drive takes a 0 to 10 volt signal as an input then I don'tneed this board at all
                and it will free up this space and that's one of my mainquestions I have So if you have any information
                you can share on theElectroCraft BRU-50 Drive it would be most appreciated and if youenjoy seeing these
                sorts of projects giving it a thumbs up will let YouTubeknow and it'll make me feel good too and finally
                if you haven't done so alreadyslide on over there and hit the subscribe button and I'll catch you

          <h2>Turret Tailstock - Machine Tool Restoration</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
                I got my workbench back, and a fresh coat of paint! But in order to make that happen, Ineeded to finish
                the thing that's been occupying it for the last four months- The turret tail stock is done, and I'm
                going to go over what it tookto make that happen today. Hey it's Pete, welcome back to theworkshop.. So
                when we last visited this project I had stripped, sanded, filled, and primed the top of the turret, and
                since then I've gone on to strip and prime the base of the turret. I wanted to experiment a bit with
                thispaint additive called Penetrol. It's supposed to help eliminate brushstrokes, and as near as I can
                tell it's basically a more "chemically" version of boiled linseed oil. It has the same warnings you
                wouldget with linseed oil about saturated rags being susceptibleto spontaneous combustion I was curious
                if it would remove enoughof the brush strokes to give me a finish I'd be happy with. I figured it was
                safe to experiment with the turret base, as it was mostly hidden and a much rougher casting to begin
                with. Overall I would have to say it did adecent job of leveling out the finish. One thing I did notice
                is that itextends the drying time beyond what the untreated paint typically takes. I believe this is
                going to affect the re-coat time as well. In my experiments, I actually had some paint failure that I
                attribute toputting a second coat on too soon I ended up needing to strip the paintand starting over. So
                I started the clean up and repair onthis Enco Hex Turret tailstock as a fill-in project about four
                months ago,when work on the Centroid Acorn milling machine retrofit had stalled. At the time i did not
                know what i was going to do with the spindle motor. Well that project is back on track and rapidly
                approaching completion,but all this time I've been working around the disassembled partsof the turret
                tail stock I decided it was time to get it put backtogether before I started losing pieces. Now
                fortunately nothing was broken onthis turret- just jammed with chips, a few munged up threads, and a
                missing screw or two. mostly just needed a good clean up. Prior to reassembly I cleaned out anypaint
                that had snuck under my tape job, filed and stoned away any dings, andre-chased all the threads I laid
                out all the parts to make sure Ihadn't lost anything, and then began reassembling the lower half of
                theturret. The mechanism down here is responsiblefor indexing the turret head over to the next
                positionwhen the turret lock has been released This small ramped piece is what releasesthe turret lock.
                Now priming the top of the turretrevealed some spots that required a bit more touching up. Laying down
                the primer creates a consistent surface finish, that makes the imperfections stand out. I mixed up some
                more of the metal glaze,and filled and sanded those spots. During the glazing I didn'tworry too much
                about the bores in the casting for the cup oilers. So i went back to clean them outbefore the final
                painting. And so i didn't continue to have this issue, I found some plugs to capthese holes, prior to
                putting on another coat of primer To paint the top of the turret, I endedup taking it back to the spray
                room at the shop I have access to. I decided to use one of theHarbor Freight HVLP spray guns. This is
                the one you can get on salefor under $10 with a coupon. I've seriously paid more than that for a
                paintbrush that I ended up throwing away. I think the orifice was maybe just a bitsmaller than it should
                have been for this paint, but I'm still happy with how it turned out. When the paint had finished drying
                Iremoved all the tape and cleaned up any paint that had snuck underneath.Stoned all the exposed metal
                surfaces, chased all the threaded holes, andcleaned out any of the bored holes. I found some replacement
                ball oilerson eBay. These are 8 millimeter and a prettygood match for the original. I just drove them in
                with a wooden dowelto avoid damaging anything. Putting this back together required abit of extra
                thought. I couldn't just put it back together the way I took it apart. Due to the tapered pin holding
                the gear on the end of the shaft, I had to index everything 180 degrees from the position it was in
                during disassembly, so that the tapered pin could be drivenin from the proper side. I marked everything
                with a Sharpie so Iwouldn't lose track of what i was doing. When I put the turret back on, I had
                toensure it was clocked correctly to agree with the position of the indexingmechanism underneath. From
                there on the reassembly was fairlystraightforward. I wasn't able to remove the originaldrive screws that
                held the machine's name tag on the top of the turret,and I decided rather than making a mess digging
                into the top, I wouldjust drill two new holes. First i used a small bit to drill thealuminum plate. I
                chose this particular cutter because it didn't walk, and it made the hole where i want it. Then i
                switched to a twist drill tofinish the holes in the cast iron. This was mostly successful, the remainsof
                the previous screws caused my bit to deflect a bit but notenough to cause a problem. These drive screws
                are pretty small andwere a bit hard to source mostly because i didn't know what size Iwas looking for.
                Turned out they were #00. This is one area on the turret I may need to revisit. I'm missing two of these
                depth adjusting screws- and a few of the existing ones are bent. Plus- the knurling is messed up. But
                that's something it can be done anytime. The turret had a few broken gibadjusting set screws and missing
                jam nuts- So I'm replacing all of them with new ones. These are dog point set screws andare a match for
                the original. I'm happy with how this turned out butI'm even happier that it's off my workbench. Other
                than the depth adjusting screws,the only other part that isn't complete are that two of the spokes are
                missing their ball ends. I may try casting or even over-molding replacements for them in the future.
                Hopefully I can put this turret to useon a project in an upcoming video. And if you want to see how I
                printedthat replacement Enco machine tag directly on metal, click that link to the left, and I'll show
                you over there.

          <h2>DMM DYN4 Servo Spindle Retrofit: Will It Work?</h2>
            <p style="color:black">

                welcome back to theworkshop. I finally made some progress on the spindle motor for the DynaMyte 2800and
                we're gonna go over that today. I've been talking about the spindle motorfrom the beginning of the
                project and I have found very little information aboutthe motor and no information at all about the
                drive. The problem seems to be that this drive was built back before everything was available online. On
                topof that I don't believe it was a large production item to begin with, and overthe years the company
                involved in its production has been through severalrestructurings. The reason this has been important to
                me is because at the end ofthis project I'd like to be able to do rigid tapping. I'm gonna need forward
                andreverse and tight control of the spindle and I have no idea if the existingsystem is capable of that
                and if it is even how to implement it. After a few false starts I decided it was better just to go a
                different direction. I explored the possibility of keeping the existing motor but replacing the drive. A
                vendor recommended what looked like a promising solution- I exchanged a fewemails with the company's
                tech support but that quickly went nowhere. I was trying to determine whether I could interface this new
                drive to the CentroidAcorn and asked what I thought was a simple question. I ended up sending
                threedifferent emails, each time asking about the control signals and each time he responded with an
                answer to a question I wasn't asking. I finally abandoned that path. The next suggestion was just to put
                a one-horsepower three-phase motor onthere with a VFD and call it a day. Initially this sounded like a
                greatoption- those motors are relatively cheap but there were two problems with it.First off induction
                motors are fairly heavy. It appeared to me that I waslooking at at least two to three times the weight
                of the original brushless DCmotor. I was concerned about being too far off with the counterbalance. The
                second issue was that this is thehigh speed version of the DM 2800 and since I do a lot of small
                aluminum parts, the high speed machining is something I didn't want to give up. Based on thedrive pulley
                ratio I calculated I would need about a 5,000 rpm motor and whenyou get around those speeds you're no
                longer talking about cheap, commonlyavailable induction motors. So finally I stumbled across a
                discussion onlineabout using an AC servo motor as a spindle motor. I found a motor and drivefrom DMM-
                Dynamic Motor Motion. This is actually a 750 watt motor and it has very similar specs to the brushless
                DC motor that it's replacing. The nice thing about this though is that in the same form factor, If the
                750 watt motor is notenough, I can get a 1000 watt motor and just slip it in its place. This isthe DYN4
                AC servo drive. This will run up to a 1000 watt motor so this willwork with either the 750 that we're
                going to start with, or be able to bumpup to the 1000 if need be without having to change the drive. So
                this isgoing to require some fabrication to design a mounting plate for the newmotor as well as
                reorganizing some of the electrical panel layout. Alright with this change we're going to be able to
                free up a lot of real estate in theupper left corner of this board. We're going to be able to completely
                get rid of the brushless DC motor drive as well as its interface board. We'll be able toget rid of this
                board here which was the original debounce circuitry for theoriginal limit switches on the DynaMyte
                system. And then this board is thespindle motor brake. We'll be able to get rid of all of that including
                themounting panel. That's going to leave us room to put in just an AC servo drivehere and then freeing
                up all this space here for the Ether1616 expansionpackage- the control board as well as both the output
                relay boards. I thinkit's gonna be a huge improvement to the whole system and I'm really anxious tostart
                tearing into this. So I want to apologize for thelack of updates lately. At the beginning of the year I
                started taking a courseand the homework severely cut into my time for making videos. on top of thatthis
                is the time of year when I prepare for my annual trade show. This trade showis responsible for about
                eighty to ninety percent of my business each year.I'm recording this actually Wednesday the 18th of
                March and I should currentlybe in St. Louis setting up my booth but at the end of last week we got
                wordthe show is going to be postponed due to the current concerns So I'm just kind of in a
                wait-and-seemode in regards to that. okay this drill bit is shot and mycollection of bits is in sorry
                shape. I really need to invest in some new bits If you have a brand you particularlylike let me hear
                about it down in the comments. Alright, so this change isalso going to allow us to clear up quite a bit
                of room down here in the lowerright hand corner of the electrical panel I've already taken out this
                panelhere that it contained a contactor and a solid-state relay as wellas the 165 volt DC power supply
                that originally fed the brushless DC Drive. sowe don't need any of that- if we do need the contactor or
                a solid-state relay I'msure we can find some other place to put them. In addition to that I'm gonna
                beremoving the Acorn power supply in favor of a larger Allen Bradley DIN rail mountpower supply. This
                one will be large enough that it can actually handle boththe Acorn and the Ether1616 expansion board. In
                addition to that I'm going tobe trying to use this Ethernet switch which is also DIN rail mount.
                Hopefullythat will work for us and not have any latency problems. So that's gonna clean up that lower
                area give us a little bitmore real estate to work with and finally I think I'm gonna remove
                theseterminal blocks here. they're not really giving us too much additional so I thinkI'm just gonna
                bring these wires straight down into the stepper drives.Get rid of that piece of DIN rail up there since
                it's really not, it's notmuch of a benefit to us the way it is right now. Rearranging the wiring onthese
                stepper drives took me a while so we're going to speed this up by about a1000% to give you an idea what
                that process looked like The size of these power wires are at theupper limit for the terminals on the
                G2551X gecko drives, so getting theminserted without any strays is tricky. Down in the video description
                I willhave links to some of the tools I frequently use on this project as wellas the hardware I'm
                installing- so if you see me using something and you'rewondering what it is, check out down there. I
                really enjoy the process of laying outelectrical panels and making them look neat as well as functional.
                There arealways some trade-offs when doing this. You obviously need the components to fitin the
                available space, but at the same time pay attention to good designpractices like separating your high
                voltages from the lower voltages The electrical panel is pretty wellcomplete and tests out. no
                explosions - no loss of magic smoke I've got some shorter Ethernet cables on order and they should be
                here next week.That will ensure that the wiring in the cabinet stays neat Next on the agenda is the
                mounting platefor the new motor. I've got the drawing started for that so I'll be finishingthat up and
                then moving on to the machining. If you do have a recommendation for a particular brand of drill bits I
                would appreciate seeing that info down in the comments. If you'd like to followthis CNC retrofit from
                the beginning that link over on the left hand side ofthe screen will take you to the beginning of the
                project and I will seeyou over there

          <h2>Ball Screw Backlash- Centroid Acorn CNC retrofit</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
             welcome back to myworkshop this week I'm getting back to my dynamite 2800 CNC
                retrofit now when Ifirst introduced this project one of the things I mentioned was there might besome
                sort of problem on the y-axis I just suspected that it just didn't feelright when I turned the screw so
                now that we actually have the Acorn boardinstalled, I've got the G251x stepper drives hooked up, and the
                CNC12 softwareis loaded in the computer, I can go in through the software and incrementallymove those
                motors and it's going to be a lot easier to tell what's going on. nowone of the first things I have to
                do before I can do any of that though isconfigure the CNC12 software; let it know exactly how many
                pulses it takes tomove that motor one revolution. now these motors are standard 1.8 degree per
                stepstepper motors which means if you take the 1.8 degree per step divide it into360 degrees then you
                have 200 total steps to make a complete revolution. Now the G251X drives from Gecko, they are micro
                stepping drives they furtherdivide each one of those steps into 10 additional micro steps. So if we
                takethose 10 steps multiply it by the 200 true steps of the motor then we findthat it actually takes
                2,000 pulses from the CNC12 software to move our motorone revolution. So the next thing we have to
                address is actually the turns ratioand this is related to the actual mechanics of the ball screw and
                thedrive mechanism from the outside of the stepper motor so any sort of gear orbelt reduction on the
                output of the motor feeding the actual ball screw andthe threads per inch of the ball screw will give us
                that ratio. okay so we'regoing to do Y-.1 and go. That's .1" -.2" -.3" -.4" -.5" -.6" -.7" -.8" -.9" At
                that point we're off by 2 thousandths. Back to Y.95 And then go Y -0.05 back to zero andthat takes us
                back to zero it is repeatable So what I could do is fine-tune my ratio a little bit. If I take the the.
                900that I was supposed to have moved and divide that by the .898 that I actually moved we end up with
                this 1.002 number. Now if I take that and I go in here- to my turns ratio, if I multiply that number
                bymy turns ratio it's gonna cause it to move just a little bit further. So I'lltake this times the 25.4
                which is already a metricapproximation so we're not you know we're not dealing with a finite numberhere
                I come up with 25.456 so we'll say 25.457 So we'll do that here, and I'llwrite that And then I'm going
                to start the processover here. Do our G91 and then we're going to start moving in 0.1 inch increments
                And again. point 2 point 3 point 4 point 5 point 6 point 7 point 8 And point 9 so we're dialed in sort
                of on the zero at this point we seem to have probablysome ware in the ball screw that's what I'm
                guessing because it seems to move,you know a couple increments right on the money, and then out of the
                blue wejump. Now I want to shift gears here just a little bit and see what we actuallyhave for backlash
                in this system. So, I'm going to start- dialed in on zero here.I'm going to move it forward ten and then
                backwards and see what we get okay so that's moving forward ten nowlet's move it backwards ten all right
                so we've got 2 thousandths of backlash inthere. so I think we've got some mechanical issues that we need
                to takecare of before we can do really anything with the tuning of this machine it was at this point
                that I realizedthat I had unscrewed the ball screw too far And I was going to need to restuffthe balls
                this is an NSK looks like 82A-16 8uz. All right let'ssee how many balls we have so what have we learned
                here? Well, we knew that thiswas a 16 millimeter ball screw and after careful counting there's
                actually116 balls which actually works out to be a good number because if we look at thisball screw this
                ball screw has four separate recirculation points so as thethread makes its way around the inside of the
                screw as it's going around on theunderside of this plastic bit here it looks like it's nylon probably.
                As theball comes around the backside and comes up over here to this part this thingshoots it back over
                here to restart in the same thread again and there'sactually four of them so actually each each thread
                or each circuit ofballs around the ball screw only occupies a single thread so there's alot there's lots
                of threads in there but we're only using basically four paths. Sothe 116 balls basically works out to 29
                balls per circuit andwhether that's actually enough or not I don't knowbut I'm going to try to re-stuff
                this and see how it feels after I do it. That'sthe first plan the balls themselves are 1.58 millimeters
                so that is the... andand those are readily available if decided to go ahead and re-stuff them. Thething
                that I'm having actual trouble locating is a ball screw with the 2.5millimeter pitch. There's lots of
                ball screws out there with a 5 millimeterpitch but this is 2.5 millimeters so it's you know twice as
                fine of a pitch.So we'll have to see but I think the first thing I'm gonna do is put itback together. In
                order to do that I have to pop these these re-circulation- that'swhat I call them- re-circulation caps.
                so that I can push the balls in becauselike I said there's you know the thread is fully- or rather the
                the nut is fullythreaded, down the length of this piece but you're only- you're not actuallyhaving balls
                in every single one of those paths.you're just having them in these four separate circuits. in order to
                do thatyou put the ball screw in and if you pop these caps out, you canpush the balls around, and when
                you see the- as you're pushing them around they'lleventually come up on the other side and you know you
                have a complete circuitwhen they're they're filled all the way so what I want to do is pop one of
                theseout and we'll put the 29 balls in and see if they fit and see if there's a gapin there or not and
                how much of a gap there is and of course this is not standardoperating procedure this is something you
                probably really aren't supposed toeven do with that said it's also not the firsttime I've done it. if we
                look at this and if the camera will actually focus onthat or not and it shows the recirculation path the
                path starts atthe backside of this screw and comes to the front side of the next one that's 2 that's 3
                28 and 29 let's put that in there okay alright, I'm gonna mark that one so weknow it's done we'll try
                another one here nine and we just lost one- oh shoot well my battery died was crawling aroundon the
                floor looking for that ball bearing but miracle of all miracles Iactually found it. It's right there.
                Let's try to be a little more careful here there we go. Now we'll just mark thesefor good measure so we
                know we did them and while I got this out let's see what thisbore is on this thing now it depends where
                you measure it's 25millimeters so if we do have to replace this, we're looking for something witha 25
                millimeter OD. Alright, so I've gone ahead and I've put the screw backinto the housing here. Now there's
                two bearings in here, these are angularcontact bearings they're in opposite orientations to each other
                and they feela little clunky to me so I think what I'm gonna do is go ahead and order a newset of
                bearings for in here and then try to determine what sort of preload shouldactually be put on those
                because really I can't say I found anything wrong withthis screw so I think that that's the next step
                we're gonna take beforeputting this back together because although I took this apart, and Iknow that
                it's together correctly I don't feel like I really found a problem.I think, I know, that when I took it
                apart the balls were falling out of it butthat was simply because I I ran the nut off the end of the
                screw too far sothat's to be expected. But this, this nut feels really good and Ijust don't, I just
                don't sense any real wear I don't see anything toindicate that there's a problem here Well that's about
                it for this week, itlooks like I'm gonna have to order some parts to continue on with this project.after
                spending this amount of time on it I really want it to be right and notfudge it so we're gonna order
                those angular contact bearings for the inputof the ball screw. In the meantime I'm gonna look around and
                see what myoptions are for actually replacing the ball screw there's plenty of 16millimeter screws out
                there - having trouble though actually finding one withthe fine pitch that this ball screw currently
                has. And as always if you likeseeing projects like this - like, share, subscribe, comment down below -
                and I'llcatch you next week

          <h2>Z Axis Counterweight Fabrication - DM2800 CNC Mill Restoration</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
           welcome back to myworkshop this week we're gonna work on replacing the counterweight
                on thedynamite 28-hundred alright so in lastweek's introduction I mentioned something about the y-axis
                backlash being a problem and I looked into it andI'm not sure it is a problem now so we're gonna pass on
                that until weactually have some motors hooked up it'll be a whole lot easier to work withonce we have
                some electric to it and we can move the motors and do some realtesting so I moved on to a different
                project. As I also mentioned one of theproblems with this machine is it's missing some pieces it's
                missing a lotof guarding but the main thing that it's missing the most important is it'smissing its
                z-axis counterweight entirely- there's no counterweight thechains are gone and all the mounting points
                are gone now the pulleys are inplace that the chains are supposed to ride over so that's still there. so
                Idid a bit of research and determined that the original counterweight wassupposed to weigh about 45
                pounds and measuring on the mill I determined thatI could fit a piece of tube steel in there about 2
                inches by 5 inches12 inches long capped off one end and then I bought about 40 pounds of leadweight took
                the whole thing outside put it on our propane burner and proceededto melt the lead down into the tube.
                Now this is part of the process that alsohappened I think about two years ago I had actually created the
                counterweightbut then didn't do anything with it so filled up the tube and then weldedanother cap on top
                of it and that's where the project set for about twoyears so had to make the chain mounts yet so I
                overcomplicated this part just alittle bit I figured the easiest way to start would be just to take
                somequarter-inch bolts and mill some flats on them so that I have a spot to hookthe chain up and that
                worked pretty well got them all to shape but it probablywould have been better had I cut them to length
                on the bandsaw first so after I had the flats milled on themI took them off to my lathe to take the caps
                off of them and that was probably amistake I probably should have just done the whole thing right on the
                bandsaw so I did end up using the bandsaw to cutthe threads down to get these things closer to the
                length they're supposed tobe so I order for the counterweight to hangperpendicular to the machine it's
                important that both chains are the samelength and of course cutting the chains the same length is no
                problem but youhave to make sure that all the mounting points are at the same height so Iscrewed the
                mounts into the top of the counter weight and then scribed themboth so they would be at the same height
                move them over to the milling machineand then drilled them then it was off to the sander to roundover
                the edges so they'd be able to pivot properly when mounted to the chain then I moved on to creating the
                uppermounts for the chain this is just some eighth inch material 3/4 inch wide thatI cut to 1/2 inch and
                then drilled in tapped for the upper chain mounts now being only 1/8 of an inch thick Ihad to grind off
                quite a bit of threads on the upper mounts and then I wentahead and silver soldered the upper mounts in
                place I had some welding spatter on thecounterweight so ground that off and then gave it a coat of red
                paint and then it was time to assemble thewhole thing and see if it actually worked fumbled around a
                little bit with thechain clips until I discovered the proper order for putting the whole thingtogether I
                propped up the counterweight on some 2x4 so I didn't have to dealwith the weight of it all hanging there
                and I'm happy with how it turned out Ithink it looks pretty much original and it seems to function just
                like it'ssupposed to okay so that's it for this week and ifyou like this kind of content please consider

          <h2>Ferrule Crimper Pliers and ferrules- tool storage with Kaizen foam</h2>
            <p style="color:black">
            today we're going to be using some Kaizen foam from fastcap to cleanup one of these
                storage cases now I have tools stored in two different ways herein the shop- one part of our shop is set
                aside for production of some productsthat we manufacture so those tools are arranged by the job that
                they do inother words everything to do a specific function so a drawer might containtweezers and wire
                cutters and a voltmeter and several different thingsin one drawer where here in the general purpose shop
                I've got things stored bytheir functions so it's one drawer of nothing but screwdrivers one drawer
                ofwrenches and things like that and I use the Kaizen foam in the production areato specifically lay out
                those tools so we know exactly where they are so we canreach for them and we also know when one is
                missing. So now that I have all ofthis organized space I've been going through and cleaning it out I've
                beenseparating some parts out try to store like things together actually purchaseda few additional bins
                to completely populate this rack and that's been goingwell but one of the things that occurred to me all
                of this parts storage enablesme to never have to store parts in my toolbox and likewise I never store
                toolsin my parts boxes with one exception I do currently store electrical tape withmy electrical tools
                my wire strippers my wire cutters needle nose pliers thingslike that similarly with the parts storage
                there's a spot where I have oneone container that's full of nothing but ferrules and it kind of makes
                sensethat I keep the crimper with the ferrules because it's the only place I ever usethem but what I'd
                like to do is neaten that up a little bit because of the waythe bins are in these cases I just have to
                take a few out to make the crimpingtool fit but it's kind of loose and it just flops around in there and
                it alsoallows the rest of the bins to move around so what I want to do is put apiece of Kaizen foam in
                there so I measure the case and find out I need apiece about six and a quarter by six-and-a-half I have
                a piece of Kaizen foam left over from a previous projectgoing to cut that to size I'm going to trace the
                outline of thecrimping tool and then I'm going to cut on the inside of that line to ensure atight fit
                I'm going to dig in two or three layersdeep here and pull out enough foam so that the tool can rest down
                inside and that's it job done well that's it for today just a quicklittle project to straighten out some
                storage if you like this sort of contentconsider giving me a like or a subscribe and we'll catch you
                next time
